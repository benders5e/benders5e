# Earthbender

Earthbenders have a special connection with the earth that is achievable with neutral jing, listening, though seemingly doing nothing and waiting for the right moment to strike. Because of their element's stability and its stress on neutral jing, earthbenders stand their ground, absorbing or intercepting attacks until they completely overwhelm their opponents. Unlike the other bending arts, earthbending's strength equally lies in both offense and defense.

#### Quick Build
You can make an earthbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Strength as your highest score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the Artisan background.  

## Class Features

As an earthbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per earthbender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per earthbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, fans  
**Tools:** One type of gaming set and one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument.
***
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Charisma  
**Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, and Nature

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* a dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- 2 fans

<div style="height: 3em;">
</div>

>##### Lifting and Carrying
> **Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry.  

<div style="height: 4em;">
</div>
### Earthbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to control earth. You can move small volumes of earth no more than one quarter of your carrying capacity – see "Lifting and Carrying". You must draw it from a source of earth within 30 feet. 

The mass of earth you can control and the range within which you can control it (including as a source) increase with your earthbender level. See the "Volume" and "Range" columns of the Earthbender Table.   

### Bending Attack
You can use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The damage it deals increases with your earthbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Earthbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).   

You use the average of your primary modifiers for attacks (this is subsequently called your "earthbending modifier"):

**Attack Bonus** = proficiency + ½(Cha + Str)   


**Damage Bonus** = ½(Cha + Str)  

### Earthwall
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your reaction to create a 10-foot-long wall in front of you once per short rest to defend against an incoming attack. Your AC for that attack increases by 2.

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

#### Praying Mantis
This style is known for its speed and continuous attacks and was famously used by Toph Beifong. When you roll a 19 or a 20 on an attack roll, you can spend your bonus action to make an additional basic bending attack. Your speed also increases by 5.

#### Hung Gar
You favor a deep, low stance rooted in the earth beneath you. You gain advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone. If another creature uses an ability that pushes you away from them, you roll a Strength (Athletics) Saving Throw. On a failure, you are moved half the distance, and on a success, you stay where you are.

#### Sticky Hands
You are well-versed in the art of neutral *jing*, waiting and listening to predict your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 to AC.

### Earthbending Forms
At 3rd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular attacks that combine martial arts and earthbending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.   

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Earthbender Table.

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions).

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 7th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Burrow
At 4th level, you learn to tunnel like a badgermole. You easily carve out large chunks of rock from the ground, forming a stable tunnel structure. However, you must find a place to deposit the removed earth.

### Earthbending specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of earthbending: advanced earthbending, metalbending, or lavabending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

### Rolling Earth
At 6th level, you learn to synchronize your control of earth with your movement. When traveling over earth and while you are concentrating, your speed is doubled.

### Expansion and Compaction
At 7th level, your control increases. You are now able to compact or expand earth of the volume and range that you can bend. You also learn to bend earth-based materials such as mud, coal, gems, crystals, meteorites, and jennamite ("creeping crystal").  

As a consequence, you can now tunnel underground without having to deposit the removed earth elsewhere.

### Earth Reflex
Starting at 9th level, you gain one of the following abilities of your choice:

##### Improved Earthwall
You can use your Earthwall ability twice per short rest. Starting now, you can also choose to use your Earthwall reaction to create a wall in front of a friendly creature instead. In this case, their AC increases by 2.

##### Imbalance
You learn to use your control over the earth to throw your opponents off-balance. Once per short rest, when an enemy in your range attempts to make an attack against you, you can try to move the earth beneath their feet to cause them to miss. Your opponent must make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a success, they make their attack with disadvantage. On a failure, the attack misses.

### Earth Elevator
At 10th level, you can move masses of earth beneath your feet to defy gravity. You can move an area of earth centered on you that is 10 feet in diameter and is holding 1 Medium creature (including yourself). At higher levels, you can carry more people, the equivalent of half your level minus 10 Medium creatures, rounded up (i.e. at 13th level, you lift yourself and one other Medium creature).

### ???
Beginning at 13th level, ... [Some improved ability or saving throws]

At 14th level, ... [some flavor-type thing]

### Improved Rolling Earth
At 15th level, you can move across difficult earth terrain (not ice, for example) as though it were normal terrain. You can also move along vertical surfaces of earth without falling during your turn.

### ???
At 20th level, ...

## Earthbending specializations

### Advanced Earthbending

#### Seismic Sense
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you are so tuned in to the earth that you can sense vibrations with your feet with such detail that you have blind sense within 100 feet. This range increases with level according to the first value in the Range column of the class table. Enemies also have disadvantage when trying to surprise you.  
Additionally, you gain advantage on Insight checks when your target is in earthbending range.

#### Earth Dive
Beginning at 8th level, you can dive into and out of earth as though it were liquid. While underground, you must hold your breath.

#### Advanced Form
At 12th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

##### Magnetization
##### Dust Stepping
##### Earth Sinking

#### Remote Earthbending?
Beginning at 19th level, ...
<!-- TODO: Change the range to not be source, except for advanced earthbending-->

### Metalbending
*Prerequisite: Find a metalbending master.*

#### Metal Touch
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can bend the small pieces of earth present in impure metals (alloys). You are able to bend such metal within touch range.

#### Suit of Armor
Beginning at 8th level, if the necessary metal is available, you can spend 1 chi to achieve the same effect as the *Rock Armor* form but create a metal suit to protect yourself instead. Your AC is 18.

#### Projectile Bending
At 12th level, you learn to bend metal without touching it. You can bend small pieces of metal (no more than 1/4 your carrying capacity) within your range.

#### ???
At 17th level, ...

### Lavabending

#### Melting Earth
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can melt a 5 foot-square area of the ground within your range into lava, provided it is earth. Once the lava is produced, it slowly hardens due to the exposure to the air. This amount of time is determined for each type of earth (no more than once per encounter) and takes 1d6 rounds (starting at the end of your turn).  
Any creature standing in the lava takes X fire damage ...

#### Volcanic Rock
Beginning at 8th level, you can harden lava into volcanic rock, willing it to cool instead of waiting for this to happen naturally. This ability takes an action and cools the entire lava mass. The resulting volcanic rock can be earthbent like any other earth.

#### Lavabending
At 12th level, you learn to move lava with as much control as you move earth. You spend an action to create and move the equivalent of a 3-foot-diameter sphere of lava at a time. When launching lava as an attack, you deal the amount of bludgeoning damage in the Bending column of the class table *and* an additional die of the same type as fire damage.

#### ???
At 17th level, ...

## Earthbending Forms
<!--Mostly defense stuff-->

#### Shelter
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You raise a rock tent around you as shelter. While inside, you have full cover and cannot attack. You can dismiss the shelter by spending another chi point.  

#### Rock Armor
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You pull rocks around you to form armor. Your AC becomes 16, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks due to your limited range of motion.   

You continue to gain the benefits of the rock armor as long as you maintain concentration, for a maximum of 1 minute.

#### Earth Glove
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You shape earth into a glove around your hand. By spending one additional chi, you can launch it at an opponent, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage. You can also use it to attempt to grab and pull a target. The target must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) or be moved against its will.

#### Earth Launch
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You use the earth beneath you to launch yourself 20 feet in the air for the duration of your turn, ending back on the ground.  

You gain 10 additional feet of height per additional chi expended.

#### Earth Smash
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You can smash incoming earth projectiles, reducing their damage by 1d10 + your earthbending modifier + your earthbender level.

#### Earth Levitation
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You stomp on the ground, using your kinetic energy to levitate a mass of earth equal to your bending capacity (shown in the class table). In the same motion, you can push the rock at a target of your choice, dealing double times your regular bending damage + 1d4 additional damage.

#### Earthwave
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You cause the earth to buckle beneath you, forming a line 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (the DC is 10 + your earthbending modifier). A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Dust Cloud
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You raise a cloud of dust, causing the effects of the *Fog Cloud* spell. If you lose concentration, the cloud of dust settles.

#### Quicksand
*Cost: 3 chi*  
Restrained and stuff.

#### Earth Column
#### Earthquakes/fissures
#### Rock cuffs
#### Rock slide
#### Water filtering
(with waterbender)
<!--#### Earth Block, Advanced: #### Earth bomb-->
