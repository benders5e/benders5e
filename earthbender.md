# Earthbender

Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders have a special connection with the earth that is achievable with neutral jing, listening, though seemingly doing nothing and waiting for the right moment to strike. Because of their element's stability and its stress on neutral jing, earthbenders stand their ground, absorbing or intercepting attacks until they completely overwhelm their opponents. Unlike the other bending arts, earthbending's strength equally lies in both offense and defense.

### Chi
Benders make careful study of a magical energy called chi that flows through living bodies. Earthbenders harness this power within themselves to exert their will over earth.

### Community and Training
Earth Kingdom, badgermoles, and stuff. What it means to leave.

### Creating an Earthbender
As you make your earthbender character, think about ...
- where in the vast expanse of the Earth Kingdom you are from, or whether you are from another nation entirely.
- How you began training in earthbending. Were your parents waterbenders? Your siblings? When did you first learn of your abilities? Who became your bending master?
- Why did you leave your home?

Earthbenders tend towards a Neutral alignment because of the strong role neutral jing plays in bending this element.

#### Quick Build
You can make an earthbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Strength as your highest score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the Artisan background.  

## Class Features

As an earthbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per earthbender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per earthbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields, guanmao hats  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, fans  
**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument
***
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, and Nature

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- 2 fans
- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack 
- 10 darts

When wearing light armor, you use your Strength modifier instead of Dexterity to determine your AC.

<div style="height:1em;">
</div>

***
>##### Lifting and Carrying
> **Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry. 

<div style="height:0em;">
</div>
### Earthbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to control earth. You can move small, contiguous masses of earth no more than your carrying capacity – see "Lifting and Carrying". You cannot shape, crack, or otherwise deform this earth, until you gain more fine-grained control through training and learning earthbending forms (see "Earthbending Forms" at 3rd level).

When earthbending up to your earth capacity, you spend 1 chi of your Attack action (see "Bending Attack" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks).  

You must draw your bending material from a source of earth within 30 feet. The mass of earth you can control and the range within which you can control it (including as a source) increase with your earthbender level. See the "Volume" and "Range" columns of the Earthbender Table. A quick reference for the weight of various earthen materials is shown below.

The HP and AC of any structure you form with your bending can be determined by regular D&D 5e object rules. The table below provides a reference for the AC of various types of earth.

### Bending Attack
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  

When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases with your earthbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Earthbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).


At 1st level, you must choose which of your modifiers to use for attacks: Charisma or Strength. This cannot be changed later.

---
<p style="text-indent:1em;">
**Attack Bonus** = [Cha OR Str modifier] + proficiency
</p>


**Damage Bonus** = [Cha OR Str modifier]  

---
The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your earthbending modifier. 

Some of your abilities will require targets to make saving throws against your bending. The DC for these saving throws is your bending DC:

---
**Bending DC** = 8 + [Cha OR Str modifier] + proficiency bonus

---
Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC.

As an earthbender, rocks that are not worn, equipped, or carried have 0 AC for the purposes of your attacks.

<!--div style="height:5em;">
</div-->
### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

#### Praying Mantis
This style is known for its speed and continuous attacks and was famously used by Toph Beifong. When you roll a 19 or a 20 on an attack roll, you can spend your bonus action to make an additional basic bending attack. Your speed also increases by 5.

#### Hung Gar
You favor a deep, low stance rooted in the earth beneath you. You gain advantage on Strength saving throws and expertise in Strength (Athletics) checks and cannot be knocked prone.   

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
\page

If another creature uses an ability that pushes you away from them, you always roll a Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, you are moved half the distance, and on a success, you stay where you are.

#### Sticky Hands
You are well-versed in the art of neutral *jing*, waiting and listening to predict your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 to AC.

<!--#### Pro Bending
Light on your feet.--> 

### Earthbending Forms
Starting at 2nd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular attacks that combine martial arts and earthbending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.   

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Earthbender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one.  

You also learn to shape earth in a more fine-grained manner, including fashioning weapons (see the *Earthen Weapon* form at the end of this class description, which you start out knowing and doesn't count against your "Forms Known" limit).

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). Forms use your bending attack and damage bonuses.

You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.  

You have 4 exhaustion points at your disposal. (Use a d4 to keep track.) The d4 starts with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter indicates a "1", you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

#### Opposing another bender's form
You can attempt to reverse the effects caused by another bender of your same element on your turn. This only applies to forms that do not require concentration, e.g. Quicksand. To do this, you use your Action to roll earthbending against the other bender's bending DC; they can choose to fail the save if they wish. On a success, the effect of the form ends.

<div style="height:1em;">
</div>
### Earthwall
At 3rd level, you can use your reaction to create a wall 10 feet long, 5 feet high, and 1/2 foot thick in front of you to defend against an incoming attack. You can use this ability after the attack roll, but before the outcome is determined.  


The wall stays in place unless it is earthbent away or destroyed by other means. As with all products of earthbending, the wall's AC and HP can be determined according to regular D&D 5e object rules. More specifically, the AC is determined by the type of earth you bend into the wall, and the HP is 15 per inch of thickness (resilient medium object).

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Burrow
At 4th level, you learn to tunnel like a badgermole. You can use your Action to choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range, up to your bending capacity. You instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
<!--based on Mold Earth-->

### Earthbending specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of earthbending: advanced earthbending, metalbending, or lavabending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

### Rolling Earth
When you reach 6th level, you learn to synchronize your control of earth with your movement. As a bonus action while you are moving over earth, you can concentrate on traveling quickly, doubling your speed.

### Expansion and Compaction
At 6th level, your control increases. You are now able to compact or expand earth of the weight and range that you can bend as a bonus action. Each compaction increases the material's AC by 1 (to a maximum of 19), while each expansion decreases the AC by 1 (see the Quick Conversions table on pg. 1). As a consequence, you can now tunnel underground without having to deposit the removed earth elsewhere.

You also learn to bend earth-based materials such as mud, coal, gems, crystals, meteorites, and jennamite ("creeping crystal").

### Chi-Empowered Reflex
Starting at 9th level, you gain one of the following abilities of your choice:

##### Improved Earthwall
You can now choose to use your Earthwall as a reaction to an attack against a friendly creature besides yourself, creating a wall in front of it instead.

##### Imbalance
You learn to use your control over the earth to throw your opponents off-balance. Instead of raising an earthwall when an enemy attempts to make an attack against you, you can use your reaction to move the earth beneath their feet in an attempt to cause them to miss. 

Your opponent must make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a success, they make their attack with disadvantage. On a failure, the attack misses. The opponent must be within your normal bending range.

### ?
Beginning at 10th level, ... [flavor]

### Rolling Earth Improvement
At 13th level, you can move across difficult earth terrain (not ice, for example) as though it were normal terrain. You can also move along vertical surfaces of earth without falling during your turn.

OR

### Earth Elevator
At 13th level, you can move masses of earth beneath your feet to defy gravity. You can move an area of earth centered on you that is 10 feet in diameter and is holding 1 Medium creature (including yourself) with a flying speed equal to your ground speed. At higher levels, you can carry more people, the equivalent of half your level minus 10 Medium creatures, rounded up (i.e. at 13th level, you lift yourself and one other Medium creature). 

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
### Psychic Bending
Beginning at 14th level, you learn to bend with minimal motion. Your use of bending becomes nearly imperceptible, and you do not suffer disadvantage on bending attacks when restrained as long as you can see your target.

## Earthbending specializations

### Advanced Earthbending

#### Seismic Sense
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you are so tuned in to the earth that you can sense vibrations with your feet. You have tremorsense within your normal bending range, allowing you to "see" anything in contact with the ground (as long as you are connected by earth). If you are standing on sand, your "vision" is lightly obscured.

Enemies have disadvantage when trying to surprise you. Additionally, you gain advantage on Insight checks when your target is in normal earthbending range.

#### Earth Dive
Beginning at 7th level, you can dive into and out of earth as though it were liquid. Your "swim" speed equals your walking speed. While underground, you must hold your breath and use your arms for mobility, so you cannot earthbend.
<!-- Also Redirection? Can say both are learned by observing waterbenders and mastering neutral jing -->

<!--#### Dust Step
At 7th level, you are able to use your control over earth and dust to move through the air. By quickly moving tiny pillars of earth beneath your feet, you gain a flying speed equal to your ground speed. [note that this is essentially covered by Earth Elevator]-->

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
#### Advanced Form
At 11th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

##### Magnetization
*Prerequisite: Advanced Earthbending specialization*  
*Cost: 1 chi*  
By controlling the magnetic orientation of particles within the earth beneath your hands and feet, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings until the beginning of your next turn, all while leaving either your hands or feet free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
  
##### Sinking Earth
*Prerequisite: Advanced Earthbending specialization*  
*Cost: 3 chi*  
Pick a target within your normal bending range. You can attempt to cause them to sink into the earth and be trapped there. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target sinks up to its knees into the ground and is Restrained. On a success, the target is moves into an unoccupied space within 5 feet and is knocked prone. A Restrained target can attempt a Strength (Athletics) check against your bending DC at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer Restrained. 
  
By spending an additional chi you cause the target to sink completely underground, where they begin suffocating.
</div>

#### Remote Earthbending?
Beginning at 17th level, ... (requires concentration)
<!-- TODO: Change the range to not be source, except for advanced earthbending-->
<!-- #### Earth Block, i.e. blocking/neutralizing attacks as a reaction -->

</div>
<!-- http://www.coyotesteel.com/assets/img/PDFs/weightspercubicfoot.pdf -->

#### Metal Touch
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can bend the small pieces of earth present in certain impure metals (alloys). You are able to bend such metal, of a quantity up to your earthbending capacity, within _touch_ range. You cannot bend metal that is being held, equipped, or carried unless the creature using it allows it.  

Your deep relationship with metal also grants you proficiency with smith's tools.
<!-- this is a cool reference: https://dumpstatadventures.com/the-gm-is-always-right/making-tools-useful-in-5e-smiths-tools -->

#### Ranged Metalbending
At 7th level, you learn to bend metal without touching it. You can bend metal as if it was earth (the same capacity and range restrictions apply to your metalbending as do to your earthbending), substituting it for earth in any form you already know by spending an additional chi. Changes in the form's behavior when using metal, if present, are marked in the form's description. 

#### ?
Beginning at 11th level, ...

<!--div style="height: 1em;">

#### Metalbending Forms
At 17th level, you learn one additional form of your choice from the following list:

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

##### Metal Encasing
*Cost: 5 chi (+1 chi)*  
*Prerequisite: Metalbending specialization*  
You attempt to encase a target completely in metal. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is completely encased in metal and is considered Restrained. At the beginning of each of its subsequent turns, it can make a DC 20 Strength check to attempt to escape, and the condition ends on a success. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it avoids being encased but takes 6d8 force damage.

Once a target is trapped in a metal encasing, you can spend 1 chi on the same or subsequent turns to compress the encasing, causing the target to take 6d8 force damage.
</div>

### Lavabending
<!-- rationale: you cause the particles of rock to vibrate quickly, increasing their temperature -->

#### Volcanic Rock
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can use your action to harden lava into volcanic rock, willing it to cool instead of waiting for this to happen naturally with the form _Solidify Lava_ (below).  

In addition, you now use heated rocks in your basic bending attacks. Although not heated to the point of melting, this earth now deals 1d4 bludgeoning + 1d4 fire damage instead of 1d8 bludgeoning. At 11th level, this increases to 1d6 bludgeoning + 1d4 fire and again to 1d6 of each type at 17th level.

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

##### Solidify Lava
*Cost: 1 action*  
*Prerequisite: Lavabending specialization*  
You harden an amount of lava weighing up to your bending capacity into volcanic rock, willing it to cool instead of waiting for this to happen naturally. The resulting volcanic rock can be earthbent like any other earth. 
</div>
  
<div style="height: 1em;">
</div>

#### Melting Earth
Beginning at 7th level, you can melt an unoccupied 5 foot-square area of the ground within your range into lava, provided it is earth. This is encapsulated by the *Melting Earth* form below.

Lava is considered difficult terrain. The damage done by lava is determined according to standard D&D 5e rules: any creature standing in or wading through the lava takes 10d10 fire damage, and creatures fully submerged in lava take 18d10 fire damage. As a lavabender, you gain resistance to fire damage.

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

##### Melting Earth
*Cost: 1 action*  
*Prerequisite: Lavabending specialization*  
You melt an unoccupied 5 foot-square area of the ground within your range into lava, provided it is earth. Once the lava is produced, it slowly hardens due to the exposure to the air. This amount of time is determined the first time you use this ability in an encounter and is equal to 1d6 rounds (starting at the end of your turn). Any creature still in the lava once it has hardened is restrained.  
</div>

#### Lavabending
At 11th level, you learn to move lava with as much control as you move earth. You can spend an action to create and move the equivalent of a 3-foot-diameter sphere of lava at a time. When launching lava as an attack, you deal the amount of bludgeoning damage in the Bending column of the class table *and* an additional die of the same type as fire damage.

#### Advanced Form
At 17th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:

<!--div style="height:2em;">
</div-->

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

##### Flaming Shuriken
*Cost: 3 chi (+1 chi)*  
*Prerequisite: Lavabending specialization*  
You flatten a fist-sized rock, heating it in the process to create a red-hot throwing star. While you maintain concentration, you can control its flight, launching it in a 30-foot line in a direction of your choice by spending 1 chi. The attack uses your bending modifier. 

Targets in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bending DC. On a failure, they take 2d6 slashing damage + 2d6 fire damage. On a success, the damage is halved.  

The shuriken is able to cut through stone and metal instantaneously. If it leaves your bending range, your concentration ends, and the rock cools and drops to the ground.

\page

## Earthbending Forms
Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC (see "Bending Attack").

#### Shelter
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You raise a rock tent around you as shelter. While inside, you have full cover and cannot attack. You can dismiss the shelter by spending another chi point.  
<!-- This is utility only, pretty much -->

#### Earthen Weapon
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You mold earth into a simple melee weapon of your choice, adopting its statistics with one exception: unless the weapon deals bludgeoning damage, you deal half damage. You have proficiency with any weapon you form. 

You use your Attack Action to make one attack. At fifth level, this increases to two attacks.

---
**Metal:** When using metal as the material for this form, you can fashion martial melee weapons in addition to simple melee weapons. You deal full damage even for slashing or piercing weapons.

#### Rock Armor
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You pull rocks around you to form armor. You gain an AC equal to the AC of the rocks used, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks due to your limited range of motion.   


You continue to gain the benefits of the rock armor as long as you maintain concentration, for a maximum of 1 minute.

---
**Metal:** When using metal as the material for this form, you create a metal suit instead, raising your AC to the metal's AC (some reference ACs are shown in the Quick Conversions table in the Metalbending specialization).

#### Mannequin
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You create a mannequin out of earth within range, which has the abilities of an _Unseen Servant_, but using your normal bendig range as the spell's range.

#### Rock Glove
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You shape earth into a glove around your hand. By spending one additional chi, you can cause the glove to leave your hand and float to an area within your normal bending range. If you launch it at an opponent, it deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.   

You can control the glove's actions, including manipulating an object, opening an unlocked door or container, stowing or retrieve an item from an open container, or pouring the contents out of a vial. You can move the glove a distance less than or equal to your bending range each time you use it. It has your stats.

If you use the glove to attempt to grab and pull a target, the target must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) or be moved up to 15 feet against its will.

The glove crumbles to the ground if it is ever out of your normal earthbending range.

<!--div style="height:5em;">
</div-->
#### Earth Boots
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You shape earth into boots around your feet. The boots give you advantage against being knocked prone or shoved but reduce your speed to 0. They last for 1 minute, but you can dismiss them early as a free action.

#### Earth Launch
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You use the earth beneath you to launch yourself and/or other creatures in a 10-foot-square in range into the air, traveling up to 20 feet vertically and 50 feet horizontally. (The maximum number of creatures you can launch is equal to half your earthbending level.)   


This jump lasts the duration of your turn; you end the turn back on the ground.  


You gain 10 additional feet of height and 20 feet of horizontal distance per additional chi expended.

<!--div style="height:6em;">
</div-->
#### Earth Smash
*Cost: 2 chi*  
When you take this form, gain the ability to use your reaction to defuse ranged attacks, neutralizing the incoming projectiles by either countering them with earth projectiles of your own or, in the case of a ranged earth attack, smashing them with your own bending. When you use this reaction, you spend 2 chi of your next Attack action. 

For projectiles of another element, the damage of each projectile is reduced by 1d6 + your earthbending modifier + your earthbender level. For earth projectiles, the damage is reduced by 1d12 + your earthbending modifier + your earthbender level.  

#### Levitation
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You stomp on the ground, using your kinetic energy to levitate a mass of earth equal to your bending capacity (shown in the class table). In the same motion, you can push the rock at a target of your choice, dealing double your regular bending damage + 1d4 additional damage.

#### Earthwave
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You cause the earth to buckle beneath you, forming a line originating from you that is 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  


Structures in this line take double damage.

#### Earth Projectiles
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create and launch 4 fist-sized rocks at any combination of targets within your long range (the second number in the "Range" column). These attacks are made without disadvantage. Each rock deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.   

You gain an additional rock for each extra chi you spend.

#### Bent Out of Shape
<!-- based on the ability of the same name here: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Earth_Bender_(5e_Class)#Metal_Bending -->
*Cost: 3 chi*  
*Prerequisite: Metalbending specialization*  
You attempt to deform a metal weapon within range. The creature holding the weapon must make a Constitution (?) saving throw. On a failure, the weapon is bent beyond recognition and is treated as an improvised club dealing 1d4 damage for any future attacks. On a success, the weapon is unscathed.

#### Quicksand
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You turn a square area of the ground up to half your normal bending range on each side into quicksand for up to 1 minute. The entire area must be within your normal range. It is considered difficult terrain for the duration.  

When this change occurs, each creature standing in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be Restrained. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become Restrained.

To attempt to break free, a creature must spend its Action to make an Athletics check against your bending DC. On a success, it moves 5 feet in a direction of its choice. If it moves out of the affected area, it stops being Restrained.

#### Rock cuffs
*Cost: 3 chi (1 chi)*  
You choose a creature you can see within range and cause rock cuffs to envelop its limbs which are in contact with the ground. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained while you maintain concentration.

By spending 1 additional chi, you can cause the cuffs to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each cuffed limb on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your bending DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

***
**Metal:** When using metal as the material for this form, the DC increases by 2.

#### Dust Cloud
*Cost: 4 chi*  
You raise a cloud of dust, causing the effects of the *Fog Cloud* spell. If you lose concentration, the cloud of dust settles.

#### Collapse
*Cost: 4 chi*  
You collapse a 30-foot square portion of a rock tunnel, ceiling, or wall within range. Any creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d10 damage, and half on a success.
<!--(collapsing tunnel damage according to DMG pg. 249)-->

<!-- #### Earth Column
*Cost: X chi*  
this is mostly superceded by Earthwave and earth launch -->

#### Earth Shift
(Maybe a feature/ability instead) You can move a creature of your choice 5 feet in a direction of your choice by shifting the ground beneath them.

#### Rock slide
#### Fissure
You make an (imprecise) fissure – at higher levels, the precision increases. Creatures may fall (Dex ST); depth also depends on chi spent (or level). 
<!-- Supercharged version of this is "tectonics", e.g. when Kyoshi created Kyoshi Island -->

#### Earthquake
*Cost: 5 chi*  
You can cause a quake. Magnitude depends on level or chi spent.
