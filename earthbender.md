# Earthbender

Earthbenders have a special connection with the earth that is achievable with neutral jing, listening, though seemingly doing nothing and waiting for the right moment to strike. Because of their element's stability and its stress on neutral jing, earthbenders stand their ground, absorbing or intercepting attacks until they completely overwhelm their opponents. Unlike the other bending arts, earthbending's strength equally lies in both offense and defense.

#### Quick Build
You can make an earthbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Strength as your highest score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the Artisan background.  

## Class Features

As an earthbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per earthbender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per earthbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields, guanmao hats  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, fans  
**Tools:** One type of gaming set and one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument.
***
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, and Nature

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- 2 fans

When wearing light armor, you use your Strength modifier instead of Dexterity to determine your AC.

<div style="height: 1em;">
</div>

***
>##### Lifting and Carrying
> **Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry.  

<div style="height: 1em;">
</div>
### Earthbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to control earth. You can move small volumes of earth no more than your carrying capacity – see "Lifting and Carrying". You must draw it from a source of earth within 30 feet. 

The mass of earth you can control and the range within which you can control it (including as a source) increase with your earthbender level. See the "Volume" and "Range" columns of the Earthbender Table. A quick reference for the weight of various earthen materials is shown below.  


The HP and AC of any structure you form with your bending can be determined by regular D&D 5e object rules. The table below provides a reference for the AC of various types of earth.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Quick Conversions
| Material          | Pounds in 1 cubic ft | AC |
|:------------------|:---------------------|----|
| Pumice            | 40 lbs               | 15 |
| Dirt              | 75 lbs               | 13 |
| Coal              | 85 lbs               | 15 |
| Sand              | 100 lbs              | 13 |
| Lava (liquid)     | ~150 lbs             | –– |
| Rock (sedimentary)| ~160 lbs             | 17 |
| Granite           | 165 lbs              | 17 |
| Rock (igneous)    | ~180 lbs             | 17 |
</div>

### Bending Attack
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  

When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases with your earthbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Earthbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).   


At 1st level, you must choose which of your modifiers to use for attacks: Charisma or Strength. This cannot be changed later.

**Attack Bonus** = proficiency + [Cha OR Str modifier]  


**Damage Bonus** = [Cha OR Str modifier]  

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your earthbending modifier.

</div>
### Earthwall
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your reaction to create a wall 10 feet long, 5 feet high, and 1/2 foot thick in front of you to defend against an incoming attack. You can use this ability after the attack roll, but before the outcome is determined.  


The wall stays in place unless it is earthbent away or destroyed by other means. As with all products of earthbending, the wall's AC and HP can be determined according to regular D&D 5e object rules. More specifically, the AC is determined by the type of earth you bend into the wall, and the HP is 15 per inch of thickness (resilient medium object).

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

<div style="height:3em;">
</div>
#### Praying Mantis
This style is known for its speed and continuous attacks and was famously used by Toph Beifong. When you roll a 19 or a 20 on an attack roll, you can spend your bonus action to make an additional basic bending attack. Your speed also increases by 5.

#### Hung Gar
You favor a deep, low stance rooted in the earth beneath you. You gain advantage on Strength saving throws and expertise in Strength (Athletics) checks.   

If another creature uses an ability that pushes you away from them, you always roll a Strength (Athletics) Saving Throw. On a failure, you are moved half the distance, and on a success, you stay where you are.

#### Sticky Hands
You are well-versed in the art of neutral *jing*, waiting and listening to predict your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 to AC.

### Earthbending Forms
At 3rd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular attacks that combine martial arts and earthbending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.   

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Earthbender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one.

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.  

You have 4 exhaustion points at your disposal. (Use a d4 to keep track.) The d4 starts with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter indicates a "1", you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 7th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Burrow
At 4th level, you learn to tunnel like a badgermole. You easily carve out large chunks of rock from the ground, forming a stable tunnel structure. However, you must find a place to deposit the removed earth.

### Earthbending specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of earthbending: advanced earthbending, metalbending, or lavabending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>
### Rolling Earth
At 6th level, you learn to synchronize your control of earth with your movement. When traveling over earth and while you are concentrating, your speed is doubled.

### Expansion and Compaction
At 7th level, your control increases. You are now able to compact or expand earth of the volume and range that you can bend. You also learn to bend earth-based materials such as mud, coal, gems, crystals, meteorites, and jennamite ("creeping crystal").  

As a consequence, you can now tunnel underground without having to deposit the removed earth elsewhere.

### Earth Reflex
Starting at 9th level, you gain one of the following abilities of your choice:

##### Improved Earthwall
You can now choose to use your Earthwall as a reaction to an attack against a friendly creature besides yourself, creating a wall in front of it instead.

##### Imbalance
You learn to use your control over the earth to throw your opponents off-balance. Instead of raising an earthwall when an enemy attempts to make an attack against you, you can use your reaction to move the earth beneath their feet in an attempt to cause them to miss. Your opponent must make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a success, they make their attack with disadvantage. On a failure, the attack misses. The opponent must be within your normal bending range.  

### Earth Elevator
At 10th level, you can move masses of earth beneath your feet to defy gravity. You can move an area of earth centered on you that is 10 feet in diameter and is holding 1 Medium creature (including yourself). At higher levels, you can carry more people, the equivalent of half your level minus 10 Medium creatures, rounded up (i.e. at 13th level, you lift yourself and one other Medium creature).

## Earthbending specializations

### Advanced Earthbending

#### Seismic Sense
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you are so tuned in to the earth that you can sense vibrations with your feet. You have tremorsense within your normal bending range, allowing you to "see" anything in contact with the ground (as long as you are connected by earth). Enemies also have disadvantage when trying to surprise you.  

Additionally, you gain advantage on Insight checks when your target is in normal earthbending range.

#### Earth Dive
Beginning at 8th level, you can dive into and out of earth as though it were liquid. Your "swim" speed equals your walking speed. While underground, you must hold your breath.

#### Advanced Form
At 12th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

##### Magnetization
##### Dust Stepping
##### Earth Sinking

#### Remote Earthbending?
Beginning at 19th level, ...
<!-- TODO: Change the range to not be source, except for advanced earthbending-->

### Metalbending
*Prerequisite: Find a metalbending master.*

#### Metal Touch
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can bend the small pieces of earth present in impure metals (alloys). You are able to bend such metal within touch range.

#### Suit of Armor
Beginning at 8th level, if the necessary metal is available, you can spend 1 chi to achieve the same effect as the *Rock Armor* form but create a metal suit instead. Your AC is 18.

#### Ranged Metalbending
At 12th level, you learn to bend metal without touching it. You can bend metal as if it was earth (the same capacity and range restrictions apply to your metalbending as do to your earthbending).

#### ???
At 17th level, ...

<div style="height: 10em;">
</div>
### Lavabending

#### Volcanic Rock
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can harden lava into volcanic rock, willing it to cool instead of waiting for this to happen naturally. This ability takes an action and cools a mass of lava equal to your earthbending capacity. The resulting volcanic rock can be earthbent like any other earth.  


In addition, you now use heated rocks in your basic bending attacks. Although not heated to the point of melting, this earth now deals 1d4 bludgeoning + 1d4 fire damage instead of 1d8 bludgeoning. At 11th level, this increases to 1d6 bludgeoning + 1d4 fire and again to 1d6 of each type at 17th level.

#### Melting Earth
Beginning at 8th level, you can melt an unoccupied 5 foot-square area of the ground within your range into lava, provided it is earth. This is encapsulated by the *Melting Earth* form in the forms list.

Once the lava is produced, it slowly hardens due to the exposure to the air unless you spend an action to harden it. This amount of time is determined the first time you use this ability in an encounter, taking 1d6 rounds (starting at the end of your turn).  


The damage done by lava is determined according to standard D&D 5e rules: any creature standing in or wading through the lava takes 10d10 fire damage, and creatures fully submerged in lava take 18d10 fire damage. As a lavabender, you have resistance to fire damage.

#### Lavabending
At 12th level, you learn to move lava with as much control as you move earth. You spend an action to create and move the equivalent of a 3-foot-diameter sphere of lava at a time. When launching lava as an attack, you deal the amount of bludgeoning damage in the Bending column of the class table *and* an additional die of the same type as fire damage.

## Earthbending Forms
<!--Mostly defense stuff-->
For forms which require a target to make a saving throw, your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your earthbending modifier.

<!--#### Shelter
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You raise a rock tent around you as shelter. While inside, you have full cover and cannot attack. You can dismiss the shelter by spending another chi point.  -->

#### Rock Armor
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You pull rocks around you to form armor. Your AC becomes 16, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks due to your limited range of motion.   


You continue to gain the benefits of the rock armor as long as you maintain concentration, for a maximum of 1 minute.

#### Earth Glove
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You shape earth into a glove around your hand. By spending one additional chi, you can launch it at an opponent, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage.   


You can also use it to attempt to grab and pull a target. The target must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) or be moved against its will.

<!--div style="height:1em;">
</div-->
#### Earth Launch
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You use the earth beneath you to launch yourself and/or other creatures in a 10-foot-square in range into the air, traveling up to 20 feet vertically and 50 feet horizontally. (The maximum number of creatures you can launch is equal to half your earthbending level.)   


This jump lasts the duration of your turn; you end the turn back on the ground.  


You gain 10 additional feet of height and 20 feet of horizontal distance per additional chi expended.

#### Earth Smash
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You prepare to defuse the next ranged attack that hits you. The next time a creature's ranged attack hits, you can use your reaction to neutralize the incoming projectiles, either countering them with earth projectiles of your own or, in the cast of a ranged earth attack, smashing them with your own bending.  


For projectiles of another element, the damage of each projectile is reduced by 1d6 + your earthbending modifier + your earthbender level. For earth projectiles, the damage is reduced by 1d12 + your earthbending modifier + your earthbender level.  

#### Earth Levitation
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You stomp on the ground, using your kinetic energy to levitate a mass of earth equal to your bending capacity (shown in the class table). In the same motion, you can push the rock at a target of your choice, dealing double times your regular bending damage + 1d4 additional damage.

<div style="height:6em;">
</div>
#### Earthwave
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You cause the earth to buckle beneath you, forming a line 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  


Structures in this line take double damage.

#### Dust Cloud
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You raise a cloud of dust, causing the effects of the *Fog Cloud* spell. If you lose concentration, the cloud of dust settles.

#### Solidify Lava
*Prerequisite: Lavabending specialization*  
*Cost: 1 action*  
You harden an amount of lava weighing up to your bending capacity into volcanic rock, willing it to cool instead of waiting for this to happen naturally. The resulting volcanic rock can be earthbent like any other earth.  

#### Melting Earth
*Prerequisite: Lavabending specialization*  
*Cost: 1 action*  
You melt an unoccupied 5 foot-square area of the ground within your range into lava, provided it is earth. Once the lava is produced, it slowly hardens due to the exposure to the air. This amount of time is determined the first time you use this ability in an encounter and is equal to 1d6 rounds (starting at the end of your turn).  

#### Quicksand
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You turn a square area of the ground up to half your normal bending range on each side into quicksand for up to 1 minute. The entire area must be within your normal range. It is considered difficult terrain for the duration.  

When this change occurs, each creature standing in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be Restrained. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become Restrained.

#### Earth Column

#### Earth Projectiles

#### Rock cuffs
*Cost: 3 chi (1 chi)*  
You choose a creature you can see within range and cause rock cuffs to envelop its limbs which are in contact with the ground. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained while you maintain concentration.

By spending 1 additional chi, you can cause the cuffs to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each cuffed limb on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

\page

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your bending DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

#### Rock slide
#### Fissure
#### Water filtering
(with waterbender)
