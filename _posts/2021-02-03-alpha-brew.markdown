Because of the growing interest in playing ATLA-like classes in the TTRPG format, I've decided to publish the current version of my Benders 5e homebrew!

This content has been in the works for almost 9 months, and although there have been a couple of playtests of this content, it's still far from a final version. Here are some parts that are still being worked on:
- high-level abilities (above 10th level) for the bending classes
- online tools to make gameplay easier, like brew-specific character sheets, starter characters, etc.
- some kinks in the mobile version of the site
- balance of some classes (Monk Way of Chi in particular)

This is an open-source project, so I welcome any contributions and suggestions. More information about contributing can be found on the [About page](./about). I'm excited to [hear what you think](https://forms.gle/H2VMopAN7gtaRrG5A)!
