About a year ago, I found myself wanting to run a campaign in the *Avatar: The Last Airbender* universe, but none of the D&D rulesets I found online appealed to me: they ruined the flavor by adding magic or out-of-universe classes, felt unprofessional and hastily put together, were too minimal, or seemed unbalanced. Plus, none really seemed to have gained traction among D&D players, unlike other homebrews I'd played, which made me suspicious. As I read, I found myself making mental notes of the parts I would change, until I realized that I might as well put together my ideal homebrew, which you see on this site!
