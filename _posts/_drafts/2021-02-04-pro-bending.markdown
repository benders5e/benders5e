The rules for running a pro bending match are now live! You can find them [here](/pro-bending). Try them for yourself and [let us know what you think](https://forms.gle/H2VMopAN7gtaRrG5A). Huge thanks to Kevin for developing this system! 

These rules will be used to run the first annual Bending Bash this March -- more on this soon! Follow us on social media or subscribe to our [RSS feed]() to learn more.
