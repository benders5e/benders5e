# Airbender
Airbending concentrates on speed and evasion, forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts. As the element of freedom, airbenders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves.

#### Quick Build
You can make an airbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Wisdom as your highest score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Hermit background. 

## Class Features
As an airbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per airbender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per airbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, gliders  
**Tools:** One type of gaming set and one musical instrument.
***
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Dexterity  
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, History, Religion, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- Glider

### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom and Dexterity modifiers.

<!--div style="height: 10em;">
</div-->
### Airbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to manipulate the air around you. You can spend 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Gust* cantrip. (See "Air Punch" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks.) Your range increases with your level according to the "Range" column of the Airbender table.  


In addition, your jump distance is permanently tripled.

### Air Punch
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  


When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 force damage. You also clear any non-spiritual fog, dust, or other type of cloud effect in a 5-foot-wide line from you to the target (not including your position but including the target's position). 

The damage caused by your attack increases with your airbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Airbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).      

As an airbender, Wisdom is your primary attack ability:

**Attack Bonus** = proficiency + Wis modifier   


**Damage Bonus** = Wis modifier

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your airbending modifier.

#### Nonlethal Damage
Airbenders, particularly air nomads, are the most peaceful benders, typically doing their best to avoid taking a life whenever possible. When you make an attack (melee or ranged) that reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to make the damage nonlethal by dealing bludgeoning damage instead of the default damage type.


<!--no stance-->
<!-- Baguazhang ("circle walking")
Xingyiquan ("mind heart boxing")
-->
### Be the Leaf
At 2nd level, you become tuned in to the air around you. You learn to move like a leaf in the wind, allowing you to evade attacks more easily. You can choose to impose disadvantage on an attack against you as a reaction after the attack roll is made, but before the outcome is determined. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.  

### Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels, as shown in the class table.  


You also learn to use your bending to steer your glider. Your flying speed is equal to your ground speed. See the Glider description (in the "Equipment" section) for more details about using your glider. 

### Airbending Forms
At 3rd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular forms that combine martial arts and airbending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.

</div>

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Airbender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one.  

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.   

You have 4 exhaustion points at your disposal. (Use a d4 to keep track.) The d4 starts with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter indicates a "1", you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Air Cushion
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to slow yourself with airbending, reducing any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your bender level. You can also use this ability on another creature.

### Airbending Specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following aspects of airbending: advanced airbending, spirituality, or ?. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description. <!--This specialization grants you a new feature at 5th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 17th level.-->

### Improved Unarmored Movement
When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Your glider speed increases to 60 feet.

### Cloudbending
At 6th level, you gain the ability to bend clouds. Once per long rest, you can concentrate on reshaping clouds for a period of time up to 1 hour. During this time, you spend your Action on every turn cloudbending and cannot use it to attack or take any other actions.

### Evasion
At 9th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

<!--div style="height: 4em;">
</div-->
### Breath of Wind
At 10th level, you become capable of displaying formidable breath control. You learn to increase the volume of your voice or sounds of an instrument you are playing.  


You are also able to hold your breath for an unusual amount of time; instead of the normal amount (a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier), you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus + your airbending modifier.

### Diamond Soul (but renamed)
Beginning at 13th level, your mastery of chi grants you proficiency in all saving throws.  

Additionally, once per long rest, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can choose to succeed instead.

### Empty Body
At 14th level, your chi sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age and you cannot be aged by unnatural means. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Wind Reader
At 15th level, you are aware of every motion in the air surrounding you. Every turn, you may take the Dodge action as a bonus action.  

<div style="height: 0em;">
</div>
### Detachment

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

***
> *Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty, and become wind.*   
> **–Guru Laghima**

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

Like the Guru Laghima and the airbender Zaheer, you learn to levitate without using bending or any other means to propel yourself. You move naturally and without having to think about it through the air, as easily and naturally as if you were walking. Your flying speed is 60.

## Airbending Specializations

### Advanced Airbending

#### Advanced Forms
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you gain access to an extended form list. From now on, you can choose forms to learn from the "Advanced Forms" list in addition to the regular list. Both can be found at the end of this class description.

You also automatically know the form *Tranquility* and it does not count against the "Forms Known" limit in the class table.

### Spirituality

#### Spirit World
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can attempt to enter the spiritworld. You must spend 1 minute meditating and make a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw. On a success, your spirit is projected into the Spirit World according to the spell *Astral Projection*.  

While in the Spirit World you cannot airbend (more specifically, you also can't make any basic or airbending form attacks and cannot use the Air Cushion and Cloudbending features.)

The spell ends only when you, in your spiritual form, return to your material body.

#### Wind Whisper

</div-->
## Airbending Forms
<!--Mostly defense/utility-->

#### Swipe
*Cost: 1 chi*   
You prepare to defuse the next ranged bending attack that hits you (not one that is the result of a bending specialization). When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your airbender level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can completely defuse the attack, provided you have at least one hand free or are holding your glider.

#### Nimble action
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You spend 1 chi to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on this turn.

#### Shunt (rename this)
*Cost: 1 chi*  
This turn, you can use your Be The Leaf reaction to shunt another creature out of the way of an impending attack, giving them the benefits of that ability.

#### Air scooter
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You form a ball our of air which you can ride up walls and vertical surfaces, but you must end your turn on a flat surface. You can immediately move 80 feet when you activate the air scooter, and you gain a ground speed of 80 feet. The scooter is treated as a mount and disappears at the end of your next turn.

#### Air ball
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You surround a creature (medium or smaller) or object with a compressed ball of air. You can move this ball with a speed equal to your own feet, including raising it up into the air. A creature in the ball is restrained.  

You can also use this technique to create a smaller ball (up to 5 feet in diameter) which can be thrown or tossed around, in the same way as a regular ball, while you maintain concentration.

#### Blast
*Cost: 2 chi*  
When you use this form, you send a pressurized blast of air at a creature within range. Make an attack. On a hit, you deal an amount of damage equal to twice your bending die. You also roll an airbending check (using your waterbending modifier) opposed by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the target fails, you can choose what distance it is pushed away from you (up to 15 feet).

Just like your regular bending attack, this form clears any clouds not caused by spirit magic.

<!--div style="height: 7em;">
</div-->
#### Wake
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You use your airbending to augment momentum of a moving object. Until the beginning of your next turn, a moving object of your choice gets a +10 bonus to speed. If the object is a projectile, it deals additional damage equal to your bending die.  

#### Funnel
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create a small funnel out of air of up to 1 foot in diameter. The funnel is held between your hands. Any small objects that are dropped into the funnel shoot out the other side, causing the funnel to essentially act like a sling (see the Sling entry in the Weapon Table for damage and range). 
<!--ex: you could make a funnel, then pick up rocks with air ball and put them in your funnel-->

#### Air bomb
*Cost: 3 chi*  
When you hit the ground after a jump or after flying, you can spend three chi to create a powerful, outward-moving air current in all directions around you. This current dispels any non-spiritual clouds of fog, dust, or other physical cloud effects.

Targets in within your bending radius take 2d6 force damage and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. The damage increases by 1d6 with each additional chi spent.

#### Gust
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You create violent gusts of air that reach out in a circle centered on you with radius equal to your normal bending range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone (the DC is 8 + proficiency modifier + your airbending modifier) and any non-spiritual clouds are dispelled. 

Non-airbenders in the area, regardless of whether they succeeded on the saving throw or not, have disadvantage of Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn, at which point the gust ends.

<!--#### Air punch/kick
*Cost: 2 chi*  
Rapid succession-->
<!--#### Air wheel -->

#### Airblade
#### Air cocoon
#### Air spout
#### Air sphere 

### Advanced Forms
Only Airbenders of the Advanced Airbending specialization have access to these forms.

#### Tranquility
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace, giving you the benefits of the *Sanctuary* spell that last until the start of your next turn. The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Heat regulation
*Cost: X chi*  

#### Tornado
*Cost: 5 chi*  

#### Asphyxiation
*Cost: 5 chi*
