# Airbender
Air is the element of freedom. Airbending concentrates on speed and evasion, forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts. As the element of freedom, airbenders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves.

### Chi
Benders make careful study of a magical energy called chi that flows through living bodies. Airbenders harness this power within themselves to exert their will on the air around them.

### Community and Training
Air Nomads, air bison, and stuff. What it means to leave.

### Creating an Airbender
As you make your airbender character, think about ...
- Which Air Temple you are from (female airbenders were raised at the Western and Eastern Air Temples, while male airbenders hail from the Northern and Southern Air Temples).
- If you are from the Air Nation, your temperament is likely very different from that of an Air Nomad (e.g. Zaheer).
- Why did you leave your home?

Because of the air's untethered nature, airbenders tend towards chaotic (or at most neutral) alignments.

#### Quick Build
You can make an airbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Wisdom as your highest score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Hermit background. 

## Class Features
As an airbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per airbender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per airbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, gliders  
**Tools:** Choose one musical instrument

---
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Dexterity  
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, History, Religion, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack 
- 10 darts
- Glider

### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom and Dexterity modifiers.

<!--div style="height: 10em;">
</div-->
### Airbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to manipulate the air around you. You can spend 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Gust* cantrip. (See "Air Punch" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks.) Your range increases with your level according to the "Range" column of the Airbender table.  


In addition, your jump distance is permanently tripled and you only spend 5 feet of your movement to stand up.

### Air Punch
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  


When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 force damage. You also clear any non-spiritual fog, dust, or other type of cloud effect in a 5-foot-wide line from you to the target (not including your position but including the target's position). 

The damage caused by your attack increases with your airbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Airbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).      

As an airbender, Wisdom is your primary attack ability:

---
<p style="text-indent:1em;">
**Attack Bonus** = Wis modifier + proficiency bonus
</p>

**Damage Bonus** = Wis modifier

---
The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your airbending modifier.

Some of your abilities will require targets to make saving throws against your bending. The DC for these saving throws is your bending DC:

---
**Bending DC** = 8 + Wis modifier + proficiency bonus

---

</div>

Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC.

#### Nonlethal Damage
Airbenders, particularly air nomads, are the most peaceful benders, typically doing their best to avoid taking a life whenever possible. When you make an attack (melee or ranged) that reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to make the damage nonlethal by dealing bludgeoning damage instead of the default damage type.

<!--no stance-->
<!-- Baguazhang ("circle walking")
Xingyiquan ("mind heart boxing")
-->   

### Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels, as shown in the class table. 

You also learn to use your bending to steer your glider, giving you proficiency with gliders. Your flying speed is equal to your ground speed. See the Glider description (in the "Equipment" section) for more details about using the glider. 


When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
### Airbending Forms
Starting at 2nd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular forms that combine martial arts and airbending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.   

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Airbender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one.  

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). Forms use your bending attack and damage bonuses.

You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
\page

### Be the Leaf
At 3rd level, you become tuned in to the air around you. You learn to move like a leaf in the wind, allowing you to evade attacks more easily. You can choose to impose disadvantage on an attack against you as a reaction after the attack roll is made, but before the outcome is determined. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

<!--div style="height: 3em;">
</div-->
#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.   

You have 4 exhaustion points at your disposal. (Use a d4 to keep track.) The d4 starts with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter indicates a "1", you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Air Cushion
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to slow yourself with airbending, reducing any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your bender level. You can also use this ability on another creature.

<!-- Could add suction here; to pick up objects (that aren't being worn, equipped, or carried) from within 5 feet -->

### Airbending Specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following aspects of airbending: advanced airbending, spirituality, or ?. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description. <!--This specialization grants you a new feature at 5th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 17th level.-->

### Cloudbending
At 6th level, you gain the ability to bend clouds. Once per long rest, you can concentrate on reshaping clouds for a period of time up to 1 hour. During this time, you spend your Action on every turn cloudbending and cannot use it to attack or take any other actions.

<div style="height: 3em;">
</div>
### Shunt (this needs a new name)
At 9th level, you can use your reaction to push your allies out of harm's way. You use your Be the Leaf ability for this, and it counts as one of your uses per long rest.

<!--div style="height: 3em;">
</div-->
### Breath of Wind
At 10th level, you become capable of displaying formidable breath control. You learn to increase the volume of your voice or sounds of an instrument you are playing. This ability can also be used to blow an extremely focused and cool stream of air at an object in your normal range, instantaneously cooling it to room temperature.  


You are also able to hold your breath for an unusual amount of time; instead of the normal amount (a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier), you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus + your airbending modifier.

### Wind Reader
At 13th level, you are aware of every motion in the air surrounding you. Every turn, you may take the Dodge action as a bonus action.  

### Psychic Bending
Beginning at 14th level, you learn to bend with minimal motion. Your use of bending becomes nearly imperceptible, and you do not suffer disadvantage on bending attacks when restrained as long as you can see your target.

  <p>–Guru Laghima</p>
</div>

Like the Guru Laghima and the airbender Zaheer, you learn to levitate without using bending or any other means to propel yourself. You move naturally and without having to think about it through the air, as easily and naturally as if you were walking. Your gain a flying speed of 60 feet.

## Airbending Specializations

### Advanced Airbending

#### Stillness of Mind
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can spend your bonus action taking a brief respite and calming your breathing, resetting your chi exhaustion die back to the maximum. You can use this ability once per long rest.

<!--#### Advanced Forms
you gain access to an extended form list. From now on, you can choose forms to learn from the "Advanced Forms" list in addition to the regular list. Both can be found at the end of this class description.

You also automatically know the form *Tranquility* and it does not count against the "Forms Known" limit in the class table.-->

#### Heat Regulation
At 7th level, you learn to use your breath control to regulate your body temperature. You gain resistance to cold damage, and warm temperatures do not make you uncomfortable, making you immune to heat exhaustion (this includes e.g. a firebender's _Heat Wave_ form).

#### Tranquility
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of the _Sanctuary_ spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal).

#### ?
At 17th level, ...

### Spirituality

#### Spirit World
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can attempt to enter the spiritworld. You must spend 1 minute meditating and make a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw. On a success, your spirit is projected into the Spirit World according to the spell *Astral Projection*. You can’t take any other creatures with you.  

While in the Spirit World you cannot airbend (more specifically, you also can't make any basic or airbending form attacks and cannot use the Air Cushion and Cloudbending features.)

The spell ends only when you, in your spiritual form, return to your material body.

#### Wind Whisper
At 7th level, you learn to communicate with creatures you are familiar with even when they are far from you through your spiritual connection. Once per long rest, you may communicate with such a creature as outlined in the spell *Sending*.

#### Spiritual Bridge
At 11th level, you can attempt to bring others into the spirit world with you. You can bring a number of creatures up to half your bender level with you, including yourself. Each creature must spend 1 minute meditating and succeed on the saving throw. Any benders lose their bending while in the Spirit World.

#### Spiritual Projection
At 17th level, you can attempt to project your spirit into the *material* world. You must spend 1 minute meditating and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw. The projection can't airbend, just as your spirit projection cannot airbend in the Spirit World.   

Your projection is able to travel anywhere in the world almost instantaneously and can pass through physical objects. It lasts 1d20 minutes. You can use this ability once per long rest.

<div style="height: 0em;">
</div>
### Offense

<!-- This specialization could be stepping on Firebender's toes...-->

#### Bonus Attack
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you fight with more ferocity than your fellow pacifist airbenders. Anytime you use your action to make an airbending attack (basic or with a form), you may use your bonus action to make a basic airbending attack. You do not add your damage bonus to this attack.

#### Deadly Strike
At 7th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a basic airbending attack, you can reroll the damage. You must use the new roll. This ability only applies to the base bending damage die.

#### Advanced Form
At 11th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list: 

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

## Airbending Forms
Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC (see "Air Punch").

#### Air Shield
*Cost: varies*  
When you take this form, gain the ability to use your reaction to raise your AC. You must have at least one hand free or be holding your glider. When you use this reaction, you spend chi from your next turn, increasing your AC by a number equal to the chi spent.
<!-- Could be regarded as an air cocoon when a lot of chi is spent -->

<!--#### Swipe
*Cost: 1 chi*   
When you take this form, gain the ability to use your reaction to defuse ranged attacks that are not the result of a bending specialization. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your airbender level, and you spend 1 chi of your next Attack action.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can completely defuse the attack, provided you have at least one hand free or are holding your glider.-->

#### Nimble action
*Cost: 1 chi*  
You spend 1 chi to take the Dodge, Disengage, or Dash action as a bonus action on this turn.

<!--#### Shunt (rename this)
*Cost: 1 chi*  
This turn, you can use your Be The Leaf reaction to shunt another creature out of the way of an impending attack, giving them the benefits of that ability.-->

#### Air scooter
*Cost: 1 chi (2 chi)*  
You form a ball our of air which you can ride up walls and vertical surfaces, but you must end your turn on a flat surface. You can immediately move 80 feet when you activate the air scooter, and you gain a ground speed of 80 feet. The scooter is treated as a mount and disappears at the end of your next turn.

You can choose to spend 1 extra chi (for a total of 2 chi) to create an air wheel instead, which also increases your AC by 1.

#### Air ball
*Cost: 2 chi*  
Choose a creature or object (medium or smaller) within your normal bending range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bending DC (objects automatically fail). On a failure, the creature or object is surrounded by a compressed ball of air. 

You can move this ball with a speed equal to your own, including raising it up into the air. A creature in the ball is Restrained.  

You can also use this technique to create a smaller ball (up to 5 feet in diameter) which can be thrown or tossed around, in the same way as a regular ball, while you maintain concentration.

With each additional chi you spend, the size of the creature you can trap increases by one category.

#### Blast
*Cost: 2 chi*  
When you use this form, you send a pressurized blast of air at a creature within range. On a hit, you deal an amount of damage equal to twice your bending die. 

Instead of dealing damage, you can attempt to push the target away. Roll an airbending check (using your waterbending modifier) opposed by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the target fails, it is pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

Just like your regular bending attack, this form clears any clouds not caused by spirit magic.

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>
#### Wake
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You use your airbending to augment the momentum of a moving object. Until the beginning of your next turn, a moving object of your choice gets a +10 bonus to speed. If the object is a projectile, it deals additional damage equal to your bending die.  

#### Funnel
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create a small funnel out of air of up to 1 foot in diameter. The funnel is held between your hands. Any small objects that are dropped into the funnel shoot out the other side, causing the funnel to essentially act like a sling (see the Sling entry in the Weapon Table for damage and range). 
<!--ex: you could make a funnel, then pick up rocks with air ball and put them in your funnel-->

#### Air Spout
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You control the air currents around you to create an air spout, raising yourself up to 60 feet in the air. You gain a flying speed equal to your ground speed.

#### Air Blade
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You channel your inner chi to create a streamlined, slicing current of air. On a hit, the attack deals an additional bending die of slashing damage on top of your usual bending damage. If you have your staff in hand while making this attack, you use its narrow profile to assist you, gaining advantage on the attack.   

#### Air Bomb
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You slam your hands or staff to the ground, creating a powerful, outward-moving air current that moves outward in a circle. This current dispels any non-spiritual clouds of fog, dust, or other physical cloud effects.

Targets in your bending radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take take 2d6 force damage and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage. 

The damage increases by 1d6 with each additional chi spent.

#### Gust
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You create violent gusts of air in a circle centered on you with radius equal to your normal bending range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and any non-spiritual clouds are dispelled. 

Non-airbenders in the area, regardless of whether they succeeded on the saving throw or not, have disadvantage of Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn, at which point the gust ends.

<!--#### Air punch/kick
*Cost: 2 chi*  
Rapid succession-->

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

\page

<!--#### Air sphere-->
#### Vortex
*Cost: 5 chi*  
In a larger version of the funnel, you direct the air in the space around you in currents to create a large vortex centered on a point within range. The vortex is a cylinder with a 5-foot diameter and height up to your normal bending range. 

A creature inside the vortex must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be trapped. At the beginning of each of its turns, it can attempt to pass through the vortex by making Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, it can move out of the vortex's space.

Any ranged attacks that pass within 5 feet of the vortex wrap around it and are redirected to their source. On each of your turns, you can spend 1 chi to move the vortex up to 30 feet.
