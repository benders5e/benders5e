### Using the Bender setting

This class is meant to be played in a world in which the only race is Human and in which the typical arcane magic is replaced with spirit magic. As such, it was not meant to be played in combination with any magical D&D classes.

If you want to include this class in a regular D&D 5e campaign, at 6th level bending attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

A custom character sheet that reflects the modifications made to regular 5e abilities, skills, etc. can be found [here](/tools).
