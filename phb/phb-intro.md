# Bender Campaign Setting
W*ater – Earth – Fire – Air. Long ago, the nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.* 

In his absence, chaos reigns, kept at bay only by brave benders who have taken it upon themselves to fill the void he left...

### Classes

- The four types of Benders (Water, Earth, Fire, Air)
- Modified Monk (with new Chi Blocker monastic tradition)
- Barbarian, Fighter, and Rogue as in the Player's Handbook
</div>

### Skills
This setting uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- No Arcana
- Replace Religion (Int) with Spirituality (Wis) *[not propagated through classes yet]*

### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional lanauge, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument.

### Opportunity Attacks
Benders can spend a maximum of 1 chi on their opportunity attacks.

> ##### Underwater Combat
> The usual [D&D 5e underwater combat rules](https://dnd5e.info/combat/underwater-combat/) apply. More specifically, for bending attacks and forms, the following rules apply:  
> - **Waterbending:** Advantage on attack rolls; normal damage.  
> - **Firebending:** Disadvantage on ranged attacks, regular roll for touch range. In each case, the attack does half damage if it is dealt underwater (since fully immersed creatures have resistance against fire damage).  
> - **Earth- & Airbending:** Disadvantage on melee and ranged attacks within normal range (automatic miss beyond normal range); half damage.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 4em;">
</div>

> ##### Nonlethal Damage
> - For **melee attacks**, only slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.
> - For **ranged attacks**, only bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.  
> 
> (Thus, for the most part, firebenders are unable to deliver nonlethal attacks.)

### Planes of Existence
#### Physical World

The physical world, sometimes also called the material world, is the plane of existence on which humans live. It is divided into the four nations of the elements: the Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. Benders (and non-benders) of each element usually live in the corresponding nation, with some exceptions. Other groups exist outside of these nations as well, such as the waterbending Foggy Swamp Tribe, the sandbending Si Wong tribes, and the firebending Sun Warriors.

The political landscape has varied over time; depending on which period your campaign is set in, areas may fall under different jurisdictions or there may even be new or altogether different entities at play (e.g., the United Republic, the Fire Nation colonies, or the isolated lion-turtle cities of Avatar Wan's time, scattered through the Spirit Wilds).

#### Spirit World
The Spirit World is a plane of existence that lies parallel to the physical world and is home to spirits. These supernatural and immortal entities span a wide range of forms and often represent some aspect of life or nature. 

In some cases, the landscape of the Spirit World mirrors that of the physical world; in other cases it is completely unrelated. It can be a very fickle place: the environment can change based on one's emotions, since the spirits are sensitive to changes in their world and any negative energy brought into it.

The simplest way to enter the Spirit World is to physically cross into it through a spirit portal. The two main portals are found at the North and South Pole. Spiritual humans can also pass into the Spirit World through meditation. This difficult process can be aided by attempting passage from very spiritual places in the physical world, or by taking advantage of the proximity of the two worlds during the solstices.

### Celestial Tracking Variant

If your party wishes to accurately track the passage of time and position of the celestial bodies to account for their effects on benders and spirits, your DM can calculate these positions according to the following rules.  


These rules are optional.

- **General simplifications.** For simplicity of calculations, many numbers have been rounded. A year consists of 12 30-day months or 360 days.

- **Phases of the Moon.** In this setting, the period of the lunar phases (the synodic month) is rounded to 30 days and begins with the new moon. The phases are broken down as follows: 
  - 1 day new moon (day 1),
  - 7 days waxing crescent (days 2-8),
  - 1 day first quarter (day 9),
  - 6 days waxing gibbous (days 10-15),
  - 1 day full moon (day 16),
  - 6 days waning gibbous (days 17-22),
  - 1 day last quarter (day 23),
  - 7 days waning crescent (days 24-30),
  - 1 day new moon (day 1 of the next cycle).  
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
Whether the moon is out during the day or night depends on its phase.
  <ul>
    <li>New moon: during the day</li>
    <!-- waxing crescent: during the majority of end of the day, minority of beginning of the night -->
    <li>First quarter: during the second half of the day and the first half of the night</li>
    <!-- waxing gibbous: during the minority of end of the day, majority of beginning of the night -->
    <li>Full: during the night</li>
    <!-- waning gibbous: during majority of end of the night, minority of beginning of the day -->
    <li>Last quarter: during the second half of the night and the first half of the day</li>
    <!-- waning crescent: minority of end of night, majority of beginning of the day -->
  </ul>
Waterbenders are strengthened as the moon grows fuller, reaching their peak during the full moon.

- **Eclipses.** Both lunar and solar eclipses occur during "eclipse season", a 35-day period that happens every 6 months. A solar eclipse occurs on every new moon during eclipse season, but only every third is a total solar eclipse; the others are either partial or annular (DM's discretion). 
A lunar eclipse occurs on every full moon during an eclipse season. Keep in mind that lunar eclipses are visible everywhere on earth, but solar eclipses are total eclipses only in a small region. 
The DM decides where the first eclipse season falls and calculates all subsequent seasons according to the rules above. The DM also decides what region each total solar eclipse is visible in.
Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse, and waterbenders lose theirs during a lunar eclipse (also called a "Blood Moon").

- **Comets.** Individual comets are periodic, but on the whole, the passing of a comet does not follow a periodic pattern and as such it is the prerogative of the DM when a comet passes. Comets strengthen firebenders.

- **Day and Night.** Firebenders are stronger during the day, when the sun is out. Waterbenders are strengthened by the moon (which may be out during either the day or the night). The relative length of day and night varies based on the season and latitude.

- **Solstices.** On the summer and winter solstice (day 16 of the 6th and 12th month, respecitvely), the physical and spirit world are at their closest. Spirits can pass into the physical world without passing through a portal. Conversely, it is most difficult to pass between the worlds without assistance during the equinoxes (which fall on day 16 of the 3rd and 9th month, respectively).

- **Harmonic Convergence.** Every 1000 years, the planets in the solar system align. During this alignment, the physical world and the spirit world are separated by nothing more than a thin veil, even closer than on the solstices.
