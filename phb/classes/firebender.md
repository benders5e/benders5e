<h1 class="new" id="classes" >Firebender</h1>

Fire is the element of power. Firebenders must be able to maintain a constant source of energy and balance in battle and direct it through unflinching conviction. This energy comes from within, but is strengthened by the sun and some other natural phenomena. 

Firebenders are fierce fighters, unleashing volleys of direct, successive attacks, but often lacking proper defensive measures. 

### Chi
Benders make careful study of a magical energy called chi that flows through living bodies. Firebenders have mastered control of the chi within themselves and are able to extend its influence beyond their body. They are remarkable among benders in that their energy takes physical form as fire, though they can also control existing flames. Firebenders learned firebending from the dragons, the original firebenders.

### Community and Training
Most firebenders live in the fire nation, though the earth ningdom also harbors a significant minority of firebenders. Some use firebending as a tool for oppression, powered by hatred and anger, but a few have learned that fire is a bringer of life instead of destruction.

### Creating a Firebender
As you make your firebender character, think about ...
- **Where you are from.** Are from the fire nation or the earth nation? Somewhere else entirely?
- **How you began training in firebending.** Were your parents firebenders? Your siblings? When did you first learn of your abilities? Who became your bending master?
- **Why you left home.** Were you forced to flee? Set out to see or rebuild the rest of the world? Or are you simply satisfying a yearning for adventure?

Because of the passionate nature of fire, firebenders tend towards extreme alignments and are rarely neutral.

> #### Quick Build
> You can make a firebender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Charisma as your highest score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier background. 

## Class Features

As a firebender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per firebender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per firebender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars  
**Tools:** Your choice of herbalism kit or one musical instrument.

<div style="height: 0em;"></div>

**Saving Throws:** Charisma, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, and Performance

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- 2 shortswords or 2 scimitars

### Firebending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to produce fire with your hands and feet. You can spend 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Produce Flame* cantrip, but you use your bending range, and the damage is determined by the "Bending" column of the Firebender table (see "Fire Jab" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks). Your range increases with your level according to the "Range" column of the Firebender table.

As a firebender, you have resistance to fire damage.

### Fire Jab
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  


When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 fire damage. This damage increases with your firebender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Firebender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).     


As a firebender, your attacks must be backed by conviction. Charisma is your primary attack ability:

    <p><strong>Damage Bonus/Bending Modifier</strong> = Cha modifier</p>

<!--/div--> 

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your firebending modifier.

Some of your abilities will require targets to make saving throws against your bending. The DC for these saving throws is your bending DC:

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
    <p><strong>Bending DC</strong> = 8 + Cha modifier + proficiency bonus</p>
</div>

Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC.

#### Bonus Attack
Firebenders are fierce fighters. Anytime you use your action to make a firebending attack (basic or with a form), you may use your bonus action to make a basic firebending attack without expending any additional chi. You do not add your damage bonus to this attack.

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

#### Dancing Dragon
You practice a defensive and circular type of bending, gaining a +2 to AC. 

You also have the ability to redirect ranged firebending attacks instead of defusing them. Provided you have a free hand or foot, you are able to reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your firebending modifier + your firebender level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you redirect the element to make a ranged attack against a creature of your choice as part of the same reaction. This counts as one of your defusion uses.  

#### Agni Kai
You are skilled at duels and excel at focusing your power on one opponent. If you attack the same target as your previous attack, you gain a +2 to your attack roll.

<!--#### Shaolin
You are used to fighting in close ranges, utilizing strong kicks and quick punches
Aspects of the firebending combat style can be seen through a similar emphasis on highly technical kicking strikes, fundamentally strong movements, and the usage of swift, direct maneuvers. Northern Shaolin is an external style that uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent.

The Northern Shaolin style emphasizes "kicking over hand fighting", or prioritizing one's legwork as opposed to the arms. Kicks are meant to "extend as far as possible without compromising balance-->

#### Chaquan
You are an expert in acrobatics and agile, graceful movements. You gain proficiency in Acrobatics and +5 to your speed. If you already have proficiency, you gain expertise.

#### Seven Stars
You favor a style that utilizes momentary bursts of extreme power at the expense of your defense. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to decrease your AC for the next turn by 2 to add +2 to the damage dealt by all your attacks that hit.  

<!-- Balance: basically "in the zone" between defense and offense, can take advantage of drops in others' guard -->

<div class="HBonly">\page</div> 
 
### Firebending Forms
Starting at 2nd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular forms that combine martial arts and firebending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.  

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Firebender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one. 

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). When you use a form, you add your bending attack bonus to the attack roll but you do not add your bending damage bonus to the resulting damage.

You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.  

You have 3 exhaustion points at your disposal. You can use a d4 to keep track: start the d4 with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter reaches 1, you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Defusion
At 3rd level, you can use your reaction to defuse an attack when you are hit by a ranged non-bending attack or a basic ranged bending attack (not one that is the result of a form or specialized bending). When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by half. <!--Any fire damage is reduced to 0.-->  


You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 11th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 3em;">
</div>

### Inner Flame
At 4th level, you gain the ability to reset your chi exhaustion die back to the maximum once per long rest.

### Firebending Specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of firebending: advanced firebending, energy reading, or combustionbending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

### Firestep
When you reach 6th level, you can use flame jets to propel yourself through the air during your turn. Your speed when you fire-step equals your walking speed. You must end your turn on the ground.

### Fire Augmentation
<!-- based on Control Flames cantrip -->
Also at 6th level, you gain the ability to alter outside sources of fire. On your turn, you can spend a bonus action to choose a flame you can see within your normal bending range that is not being produced by another firebender. You affect it in one of the following ways: 
- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction.
- You instantaneously extinguish the flames.
- You cause the flame to grow hotter and brighter, increasing the damage taken by a creature that comes into contact with it by your bending die, and doubling the area of bright and dim light cast by the flame. The change lasts for 1 hour.

### Lightning Redirection

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 1em;">
</div>

Starting at 9nd level, when you are hit by lightning or electricity (natural or created by a bender), you can use your reaction to attempt to redirect it. You must create a path for the energy to flow from your fingertips into your stomach -- the sea of chi -- and out your other arm. The lightning can be deadly if it passes through your heart. 

Make a Wisdom saving throw. If you roll a 10 or higher, you successfully redirect the lightning at an unoccupied space within range, taking no damage. On a 15 or higher, you can choose to redirect the lightning anywhere within range as if you were generating it yourself. If you roll below a 10, you take double the normal damage of the attack.

### Fierce Fighter
Beginning at 10th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a basic firebending attack, you can reroll the damage. You must use the new roll. This ability does not apply to additional damage dice (e.g., the Colorful Flame damage) beyond the "bending" die listed in the table.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

<div class="HBonly">\page</div>

### Fire Rockets
At 13th level, the power of your Firestepping increases. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can end your turn in the air without falling.

### Psychic Bending
Beginning at 14th level, you learn to bend with minimal motion. Your use of bending becomes nearly imperceptible, and you do not suffer disadvantage on bending attacks when restrained as long as you can see your target.

### ?
At 15th level, ... [ribbon]

### Element of Power
At 20th level, the power of your inner flame grows, increasing your stamina. You now have 5 chi exhaustion points at your disposal and thus you now use a 1d6 as your chi exhaustion die.

## Firebending Specializations

### Advanced Firebending

#### Colorful Flame 

Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, your fire begins to develop a character of its own. When you gain this ability, choose one of the colors below. Bending attacks that are not the result of a form deal an additional 1d4 of the damage type determined by your fire's color. This includes your bonus attack.

At 11th level this damage increases to 1d6, and again to 1d8 at 17th level.

| Color     | Damage Type   |
|:----------|:--------------|
| Blue      | Lightning     |
| Red-orange| Fire          |
| Green     | Acid          |
| Yellow    | Radiant       |
| Black     | Necrotic      |
| White     | Cold          |

#### Fine-grained Control
At 7th level, when using a form, you are able to control your bending to protect your friends and allies while still raining fury on your foes. Each time you make an attack, you can choose up to one creature to exclude from the attack, causing them to take no damage even if they are within its area of effect. This number increases by 1 creature every two levels you gain.

#### Heat Control
At 11th level, you learn to control not only fire, but any heat housed by matter. By touching an object, you can siphon off heat by spending an amount of time that depends on the material (some examples are shown in the table below). You must have one hand on the material and one hand free.  

You can also have the opposite effect: if you have hands or nose or mouth free, you can heat up materials in the vicinity with an action, causing them to reach a temperature equal to the result of being exposed to a hot flame for half an hour. (You cannot use this ability to, for exmaple, heat rock into lava.)

This ability gives you resistance to cold damage.

<h5 class="tableHeader">Cooling Time</h5>

| Material | Minutes              |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Metal    | 1d8                  |
| Lava mass| 1d6                  |

#### Dragonfire
For a long time, disciplines of firebending were taught to be fueled by hatred, as opposed to the original source. At 17th level, you learn of the true nature of firebending: it represents energy and life, not anger and destruction. 

With this knowledge, your fire becomes an extension of your body rather than merely a tool for protection. It becomes beautiful and multi-colored, and your allies within 30 feet who can see the flames gain the benefits of the *Bless* spell.

The damage of your basic attacks also increases to 2d8.


### Lightningbending

#### Shocking Strike
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to distinguish the yin and yang of energy, allowing you to conduct currents and amass small charges of electricity to release at will.

When you hit with a basic firebending attack, you can choose to try to stun your target instead of dealing damage. On a hit, instead of taking damage, the target makes a Constitution saving throw against your bending DC. On a failure, it is stunned until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bending modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Create Lightning
At 7th level, you learn to separate the positive from the negative energy. This creates an imbalance, and when the energies attempts to restore balance by crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.  

You learn the *Lightning* form described in the "Forms" section at the end of this class description.

#### Lightning Arcs
At 11th level, your lightning attacks have the potential to arc from one target to the next. Whenever you use the *Lightning* form, any creatures within 5 feet of the initial target also become targets, any creatures within 5 feet of them become targets, and so on. Each target gets to make a Dexterity saving throw as described by the *Lightning* form.
<!-- could be revisited to model it more on the Chain Lightning spell (depending on how over-/underpowered it is in its current form) -->

<div class="HBonly">\page</div> 

### Energy Reading

#### Chi Sensing
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to sense the chi paths in people and interpret their spiritual energy. You may use an action to touch a creature and end one disease or condition (blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned) on it.   


Additionally, you can sense this energy and heat emanating from creatures even from afar. As a bonus action, you can open your awareness to detect life forms around you. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any warm-blooded life forms within your bending range that are not behind total cover. You know the type (human or beast) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity.

You can use each of these features a number of times equal to your bending modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Healing
At 7th level, you learn to clear blocked chi paths within creatures and redirect their energy towards wounds to speed up the healing process. By spending one minute concentrating on reading the chi paths in another person's body, you heal them by an amount of hit points equal to three times your firebender level.  

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

#### Mass Heal
At 11th level, you can use your firebending to channel your healing abilities in combat. Anytime you make an attack, you can spend 1 additional chi to cause the attack to confer healing benefits instead of damage. The attack automatically "hits" any allies and heals them by an number of hit points equal to your firebender level.  

This counts as a use of your healing ability.

#### Minor Energybending
At 17th level, you learn to bend the energy within people's bodies to a limited extent. Once per long rest, you may spend an action to do one of the following:

- End a temporary bending block caused by bloodbending
- Give a target advantage on one skill or saving throw for the next 24 hours
- Increase one creature's hit point maximum by 10 + your firebending modifier for the next 24 hours
- Confer the benefits of a 1st level _Bless_ spell on one creature for the next 24 hours

### Combustionbending
<!--You can blow stuff up with your mind!  
Level ideas: silent, multiple simultaneous projectiles, increasing power/range/radius of blast.-->

Combustionbenders possess the rare ability to firebend with their minds. Instead of using movement to focus their chi, they gather chi from their stomachs – the "sea of chi" – and carefully direct this energy through the Light Chakra in the forehead. To help channel the energy, their foreheads are often marked by an intricate third-eye tattoo.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 6em;">
</div>

#### Uncanny Focus
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to channel your chi with great precision and focus, allowing you to use your bending over incredible distances. By spending 1 chi, you can use your long bending range instead of the normal range for any form or attack without incurring disadvantage. This precision and power also allows you to deal double damage on your first turn of combat.

#### Mind's Eye
At 7th level, you learn to firebend without moving your limbs, channeling your bending through your forehead instead. Because your bending requires no movement, you have advantage on attacks against targets you have not yet attacked in the current combat. You also gain advantage on initiative.

#### Combustion
At 11th level, you can cause explosions with your basic bending attack. Instead of making a firebending attack, you can choose to make a combustion attack. Pick a point within range on which to center the explosion. Targets in a 5-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bending DC. On a failure, they take your bending damage in force damage, and on a success they take half damage.

#### Advanced Forms
At 17th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Charged Attack</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Prerequisite: Combustionbending specialization</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: X chi</p>

<div class="HBonly">\page</div>

## Firebending Forms
Most forms require you to roll to attack, adding your bending attack bonus. You do *not* add a bonus to the damage caused by forms.

Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC.

All bonuses are defined at the beginning of the class description (see "Fire Jab").

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Flashbang</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 1 chi</p>
    You cause a bright flash, blinding a target within 5 feet of your choice. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded until the end of its next turn.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Flaming Armor</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You cause flames to spring up around you. They follow you around as you move and last for 1 minute. During this time, whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, it takes 5 fire damage. 

    This damage increases by 5 for each additional chi spent.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Fire Blade</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You narrow and condense your flame projection, creating a thin blade of fire to slice at a target, dealing 1d8 slashing damage + 1d8 fire damage.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Sweeping Fire</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You sweep your legs in an arc around you, causing fire to spread out in a 20-foot radius circle with you at the center. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful save. 

    The radius increases by 10 feet with each additional chi you spend.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Fire Bomb</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You create a flame at the end of one of your limb and thrust it onto the ground in an explosive burst at a point within range. Targets in a 10-foot radius of the burst must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 2d6 force damage and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage. 

    The radius increases by 5 feet with each additional chi spent.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Fire Daggers</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You create two blowtorch-like jets from your fists or fingertips to use as close range melee attacks. As part of the same motion used to create them, you can make two attacks dealing 1d4 slashing damage + 1d4 fire  damage.  

    The daggers remain as long as you maintain concentration. You can continue to attack with them, each time spending 2 chi to make two hits. You add your damage bonus to the damage of both attacks.  

    Despite their slashing capabilities, these daggers lack the ability to block physical objects.
</div>

<div class="HBspacing" style="height:4em;">
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Shield of Fire</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    When you take this form, gain the ability to use your reaction to raise your AC by 2. When you use this reaction, you spend 2 chi of your next Attack action. 

    If the shield causes the attack to miss, the shield disintegrates; otherwise, it remains for a maximum of 1 minute.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Lashing Flames</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You shape your flame into a lashing tendril and swipe at a target within range, dealing 2d8 bludgeoning damage. 

    For each additional chi point you spend, you create and attack with another fire lash, dealing an additional die of damage.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Projectiles</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You create and launch 4 miniature fireballs at any combination of targets within your long range (the second number in the "Range" column). These attacks are made without disadvantage. Each fireball deals 1d4 fire damage.   


    You gain an additional fireball for each extra chi you spend.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Fire Stream</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You shoot a continuous stream of fire from their fingertips, fists, palms, or legs, forming a line 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.   


    The stream widens by 5 feet for each additional chi you spend.
</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Lightning</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Prerequisite: Lightningbending, 7th level</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 3 chi</p>

</div>

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Wall of Flames</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 4 chi</p>
    You cast the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall of Fire</span> spell with a range equal to your normal bending range.

#### Fire jabs
This is the regular attack? Or should this be like Flurry of Blows?
-->

<div class="formCard fire">
    <h4>Heat Wave</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 6 chi</p>

        <li>Loss of 1 chi exhaustion point</li>

<!--#### Fire Comet
#### Fire Pinwheel
