<!--## Bracers of Defense
*Uncommon item*

+1 to AC

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Boomerang._** 
You can make both melee and ranged attacks with a boomerang. When thrown for a ranged attack, on a miss, the boomerang returns to your hand unscathed at the beginning of your next turn.

**_Fans._** 
Fans are usually found in pairs, but can still be wielded individually. Taking your fans out or putting them away takes a bonus action. Opening or closing them does as well. You can still earthbend while holding the fans; they augment your bending, increasing your range by 10 feet.

**_Glider._**
Opening or closing your glider takes a bonus action. When holding the glider in the closed position, you can use it to channel your bending as if it were a free hand.  

When the glider is open, you can use a bonus action to fly. Flying requires airbending, so only airbenders will be able to use a glider to fly. You must use 5 feet of ground movement to take off, at which point you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. 

Your hands and feet are both occupied when gliding, so if you use them to bend or for another action you must let go of the glider. If you let go with one hand, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control of the glider.

You can attempt to carry another other person in addition to you on the glider. In this case, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control. The DC increases by 3 with each additional person on the glider.

**_Guanmao Hat._**
This large-brimmed hat is flat and shield-like, allowing the wearer to defuse various attacks by lowering their head. It confers +1 to AC and costs 10gp.

**_Hooked Swords._**
On a hit, you can make an opposed Dexterity check against the target's Strength. On a success, the target is disarmed and its weapon clatters to the ground in the nearest empty space (your choice if there are multiple options). If the target is wielding more than one weapon, only one of them falls to the ground.

**_Spirit Water._**
When used by a waterbender for healing, it restores double the amount of HP granted by healing with regular water.

**_Water pouch._**
A water pouch holds the equivalent of a 1-foot-diameter sphere of water. It is typically worn on the waist and can be used for waterbending when no water source is within range.
