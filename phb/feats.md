### Elemental Parry

You've become adept at fighting benders of a particular element of your choice. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn the following two combat maneuvers, which are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. 

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>
    <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Parry.</span></strong> When a bender of your chosen element damages you with a melee attack that is not the result of a bending specialization, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your superiority die.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong><emph>Defusion.</emph></strong> When a bender of your chosen element damages you with a ranged attack that is not the result of a bending specialization, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to defuse the attack, reducing the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
    </li>
    </ul>
</div>

- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one superiority die, which is a d6. This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

### Fortuneteller
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can cast the spell *Augury* at will (you must have the necessary material components). 

### Teamaker
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks identifying whether leaves or herbs can be used to brew tea.
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks when foraging for tea leaves.
- Once per long rest, if you have tea leaves or herbs available, you can create an infusion laced with healing power. Any creature who drinks it gains the benefits of a Potion of Healing. Drinking more than once from the infusion does not confer any additional benefits.

### Resourceful Bender
*Prerequisite: the ability to bend an element*  

<div class="HBonly" style="height:0em;"></div>

Your ingenuity and experience with a variety of adversaries have allowed you to adapt another element's fightning style and make it your own. Pick one form from another element-bender's form list (not one that requires a bending specialization). You can add this form to your list of known forms, and it doesn't count against the total number of forms you know (as indicated by the "Forms Known" column of the Bender Table).

When you use this form, you adapt it to use your element instead of the original element, causing it do deal your element's damage type instead of the original damage type. You also use your bending modifiers and DCs.

### Martial Bender
*Prerequisite: the ability to bend an element*   

<div class="HBonly" style="height:0em;"></div>

You've learned to use your bending in conjunction with weapons when you fight. 
- You can bend even when your hands are occupied by melee weapons
- When you use the Attack action with a melee weapon on your turn, you can make basic bending attack as part of the same attack.
