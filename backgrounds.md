Some backgrounds are nation-specific. Backgrounds that can only be taken by Benders (of the corresponding element) are marked with an asterisk.

## All Classes
These backgrounds can be taken by any class.

### Faction Agent
*Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*  
<!--"Faction Agent" background in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide-->

You are a member of a secret order, such as the Order of the White Lotus or the Order of the red Lotus.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, appropriate to your faction 
**Tool Proficiencies:** Pai sho set, disguise kit  
**Equipment:** Badge or emblem of your faction (for example a white lotus pai sho tile), a copy of a seminal faction text (or code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Safe Haven
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.

### Cloistered Scholar  
*Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*  
<!--https://5ebackgrounds.com/cloistered-scholar/ -->

**Skill Proficiencies:**  History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Any two of your choice  
**Equipment:** The scholar's robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Library Access
Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy to a fellow scholar.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth - perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.

### Fisher
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  
<!--https://ghostsofsaltmarsh-9.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/saltmarsh-backgrounds -->

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice  
**Equipment:** Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

**Other Proficiencies:** Swim speed 30 feet  

#### Feature: Harvest the Water
You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

#### Fishing Tale
You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale.

| d8 | Tale |
|:---|:-------------|
| 1  | **Lobster Wrestling.** You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster. |
| 2  | **It Dragged the Boat.** You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles. |
| 3  | **Fins of Pure Gold.** You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it. |
| 4  | **Ghost Fish.** You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see. |
| 5  | **Nemesis Clam.** A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you'll find that clam. |
| 6  | **It Swallowed the Sun.** You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night. |
| 7  | **Dive into the Abyss.** You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since. |
| 8  | **Love Story.** You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically. |

#### Suggested Characteristics
Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.

*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  
<!--https://ghostsofsaltmarsh-9.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/saltmarsh-backgrounds -->

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water, land)   
**Equipment:** A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of your ship or company, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

**Other Proficiencies:** Swim speed 30 feet  

#### Feature: Steady
You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see "Travel Pace" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.

#### Hardship Endured
Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.

| d6 | Hardship
|:---|:-----------------------------------

| 3  | **Sacrifice.** You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you're dead.

| 5  | **Stowaway.** For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.
| 6  | **Leave None Behind.** You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.

| 1  | **Teamwork.** Success depends on cooperation and communication. (Good)
| 2  | **Code.** The marines' code provides a solution for every problem, and following it is imperative. (Lawful)

| 5  | **Bravery.** To act when others quake in fearâ€”this is the essence of the warrior. (Any)
| 6  | **Perseverance.** No injury or obstacle can turn me from my goal. (Any)

**Tool Proficiencies:** Carpenter's tools, Vehicles (water)  
**Equipment:** A set of well-loved carpenter's tools, a blank book, 1 ounce of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler's clothes, and a leather pouch with 10 gp

Provided you have carpenter's tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 Ã— your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.

#### Life at Sea
Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character.

| d6 | Sea's Influence
|:---|:-----------------------------------

| 5  | **Low Places.** You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals' ships in exchange for coin and favors.
| 6  | **Mysteries of the Deep.** You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous.

Your bond might be associated with other members of your tribe, or a location or an object that is important to your tribe. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your tribe, but might be more personal in nature.

## Earth

### \*Sandbender

You hail from the Si Wong Desert. Your time in this arid biome has forced you to master a special form of earthbending known as sandbending.  

**Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Intimidation  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Glassblower's tools, one type of gaming set  
**Equipment:** A grappling hook, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp 

#### Feature: Sandbending
You are accustomed to traveling in the desert, so sand is not difficult terrain for you.

The following earthbending forms are available to you in addition to the forms listed in the Earthbender class description. Futhermore, when you reach 6th level, you learn to bend glass in addition to the other earth-based materials described in "Expansion and Compaction".

##### Quick Conversions

| Material          | Pounds in 1 cubic ft | AC |
|:------------------|:---------------------|----|
| Glass             | 155 lbs              | 13 |

<!--div style="height: 2em;">
</div-->

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

<h5>Earth to Sand</h5>

*Cost: 1 chi*  
You turn a 30-foot square area of earth in your bending range into sand. This area becomes difficult terrain.
  
<h5>Sandstorm</h5>

*Cost: 4 chi*  
You raise the sand around you and launch it into the air, creating a sandstorm that fills a cylinder centered on you with diameter and height equal to your bending range. Creatures in the area are Blinded.

Each target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, sand enters its lungs and it suffers 1 level of exhaustion (to a maximum of level 1).

The sandstorm lasts until the start of your next turn.

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a desert-dweller. 

Your bond is likely associated with other members of your clan, or a location or an object that is important to your people.

<!-- ## Fire -->

## Air
### \*Air Nomad

Air Nomad children are raised in Air Nomad temples from a young age, developing parental bonds with the nomad assigned to their training. A large part of this training is spiritual, which leads to all Air Nomads realizing their connection to their inner chi and unlocking the ability to airbend.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana (Spirituality) and your choice of Animal Handling or History  
**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools, pai sho set  
**Equipment:** A set of robes, 5 sticks of incense, and a pouch containing 5 gp 

#### Feature: Meditation
Air Nomads don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that others do from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the hermit background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate.

When choosing your ideal, keep in mind that the Air Nomads are a peaceful people who eschew violence of all sorts and thus tend to a neutral or good alignment.
