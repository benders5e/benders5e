# Firebender
As the element of power, firebenders have to be able to maintain a constant source of energy and balance in battle, unleashing a volley of direct, successive attacks. 

#### Quick Build
You can make a firebender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Charisma as your highest score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier background. 

## Class Features

As a firebender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per firebender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per firebender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars  
**Tools:** Pai Sho and one of herbalism kits or one musical instrument.
***
**Saving Throws:** Charisma, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Deception, History, Insight, Performance, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- 2 shortswords

### Firebending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to produce fire with your hands. You can spend 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Produce Flame* cantrip. (See "Fire Jab" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks.) Your range increases with your level according to the "Range" column of the Firebender table.

<div style="height: 9em;">
</div>
### Fire Jab
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  

When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 fire damage. This damage increases with your firebender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Firebender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).     


As a firebender, Charisma is your primary attack ability:  


**Attack Bonus** = proficiency + Cha modifier   


**Damage Bonus** = Cha modifier  

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your firebending modifier.


### Defusion
Starting at 2nd level, once per short rest, you can use your reaction to defuse an attack when you are hit by a basic ranged firebending attack (not one that is the result of a firebending form, and not specialized firebending such as combustion). When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by half.  
Starting at 4th level, you can do this even if you have no hands free, as long as you have at least one foot free.

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

#### Dancing Dragon
You practice a defensive and circular type of bending, gaining a +2 to AC.

#### Agni Kai
You are skilled at duels and excel at focusing your power on one opponent. If you attack the same target as your previous attack, you gain a +2 to your attack roll.

#### Chaquan
You are an expert in acrobatics and agile, graceful movements. You gain +5 to your speed and proficiency in Acrobatics. If you already have proficiency, you gain expertise.

<!--#### Shaolin
You are used to fighting in close ranges, utilizing strong kicks and quick punches
Aspects of the firebending combat style can be seen through a similar emphasis on highly technical kicking strikes, fundamentally strong movements, and the usage of swift, direct maneuvers. Northern Shaolin is an external style that uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent.

The Northern Shaolin style emphasizes "kicking over hand fighting", or prioritizing one's legwork as opposed to the arms. Kicks are meant to "extend as far as possible without compromising balance-->

#### Seven Stars
You favor a style that utilizes momentary bursts of extreme power at the expense of your defense. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to decrease your AC for the next turn by 2 to add +2 to the damage dealt by all your attacks that hit.

</div>
### Firebending Forms
At 3rd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular forms that combine martial arts and firebending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.   

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Firebender Table.   

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions).

<div style="height: 6em;">
</div>
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 7th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Fire Kick
At 4th level, you gain more fine-grained control over fire. You learn to produce fire from your feet in addition to your hands and no longer need to keep your hands free to firebend.

### Firebending Specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of firebending: advanced firebending, energy reading, or combustionbending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
\page 
### Firestep
At 6th level, you can use flame jets to propel yourself through the air during your turn. You use your normal speed and movement when you fire-step and you must end your turn on the ground.

### Create Lightning
At 7th level, you learn to distinguish the yin and yang of energy and separate the positive from the negative energy. This creates an imbalance, and when the energies attempts to restore balance by crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.  

You learn the Lightning form described in the "Forms" section at the end of this class description.

### Improved Defusion
Starting at 9nd level, you can use Defusion to defuse basic ranged attacks of any element.

### ???
Beginning at 10th level, ... (something utility-based, maybe something like *Prestidigitation* with fires and stuff, but a little more powerful)

### ???
Beginning at 13th level, ... [Some improved ability or saving throws]

### ???
At 14th level, ... [some flavor-type thing]

### Fire Rockets
At 15th level, the power of your Firestepping increases. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can end your turn in the air without falling.

### Dragonfire
For a long time, disciplines of firebending were taught to be fueled by hatred, as opposed to the original source. At 20th level, you learn of the true nature of firebending: it represents energy and life, not anger and destruction. 

With this knowledge, your fire becomes an extension of your body rather than merely a tool for protection. It becomes beautiful and multi-colored, and anyone who looks at it gains the advantages of the *Guidance* cantrip. 

<div style="height: 12em;">

## Firebending Specializations

### Advanced Firebending

#### Fire Augmentation
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you are able to alter the quality of outside sources of fire. On your turn, you can spend your action to put out any fires within your range (excluding fire being produced by another firebender) without moving.   

You can also ...

#### ???
At 8th level, ...

#### Lightning Redirection
At 12th level, when someone else shoots lightning at you, you can attempt to redirect it by making a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you can choose to redirect the lightning in any direction of your choice as if you were generating it yourself. On a failure, you take 8d6 lightning damage.

<div style="height: 5em;">
</div>

> *If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to the shoulder, then down into the stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body; it is called the sea of chi. From your stomach you direct it up again and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical; you must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly.*   
> **–Iroh, inventor of lightning redirection**

<div style="height: 3em;">
</div>
#### Heat Control
At 17th level, you learn to control not only fire, but any heat housed by matter. By touching an object, you can siphon off heat by spending an amount of time that depends on the material (some examples are shown in the table below). You must have one hand on the material and one hand free.  
You can also have the opposite effect: if you have hands or nose or mouth free, you can heat up materials in the vicinity with an action, causing them to reach a temperature equal to the result of being exposed to a hot flame for half an hour. (You cannot use this ability to, for exmaple, heat rock into lava.)

##### Cooling Time
| Material | Minutes              |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Metal    | 1d8                  |
| Lava mass| 1d6                  |

### Energy Reading

#### Chi Paths
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to sense the chi paths in people and interpret their spiritual energy. You may use an action to touch a creature and end any condition (poisoned, etc.) on it.

#### Healing
At 8th level, ...

#### ???
At 12th level, ...

#### Minor Energybending
At 17th level, you learn to bend the energy within people's bodies to a limited extent. Once per long rest, you may spend an action to do one of the following:
- End a temporary bending block caused by bloodbending
- ... (Some kind of buff like *Guidance*)
- ... (Give them advantage on some saving throws)

<!--At 20th level, you gain energybending. It is a highly dangerous technique; if one's own energy is impure and therefore bendable, the practitioner will be consequently destroyed. Energybending allows the user to remove other people's bending abilities; restore them after a bender had their abilities blocked by bloodbending; and use the art to create a spiritual projection.

(Needs more description of mechanics; high stakes if you fail a wisdom saving throw or something.)-->

### Combustionbending
<!--You can blow stuff up with your mind!  
Level ideas: silent, multiple simultaneous projectiles, increasing power/range/radius of blast.-->

#### Mind's Eye
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can fire bend even if your limbs are restrained as long as your head is free. You must take a deep breath before you do this, so you have disadvantage on Stealth checks while you use this ability.

#### Combustion
At 8th level, [you can blow stuff up when using your Mind's Eye ability]

#### Advanced Forms
At 12th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

##### Flame Redirection
(learn by observing water)

##### Charged Attack
##### Breath of Fire
(stealthy)

#### ???
At 17th level, ...

## Firebending Forms
<!--Mostly offense stuff-->

#### Fire Blade
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You narrow and condense your flame projection, creating a thin blade of fire to slice at a target, dealine 1d8 slashing damage + 1d8 fire damage.

<div style="height:5em;">
</div>
#### Sweeping Fire
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You sweep your legs in an arc around you, causing fire to spread out in a 20-foot radius circle with you at the center. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful save. The damage increases by 2d6 with each additional chi you spend.

#### Fire Bomb
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create a flame at the end of one of your limb and thrust it onto the ground in an explosive burst at a point within range. Targets in a 10-foot radius of the burst take 2d6 force damage and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. The damage increases by 1d6 with each additional chi spent.

#### Fire Daggers
*Cost: 2 chi (1 chi)*  
You create two blowtorch-like jets from your fists or fingertips to use as close range melee attacks. As part of the same action used to create them, you can make two attacks dealing 1d4 slashing damage + 1d4 fire  damage.  

The daggers remain as long as you maintain concentration. You can continue to attack with them, each time spending 1 chi to make two hits. You add your damage bonus to the damage of both attacks.  

Despite their slashing capabilities, these daggers lack the ability to block physical objects.

#### Shield of Fire
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You prepare to defuse the next attack that hits you. The next time a creature rolls to attack you and hits, you can use your reaction to raise your AC by 2. If this causes the attack to miss, the shield disintegrates.

#### Fire Lashes
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You shape your flame into a lashing tendril and swipe at a target within range, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage. For each additional chi point you spend, you create and attack with another fire lash, dealing an additional die of damage.

#### Projectiles
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create and launch 4 miniature fireballs at any combination of targets within your long range (the second number in the "Range" column). These attacks are made without disadvantage. Each fireball deals 1d4 fire damage.   

You gain an additional dagger for each extra chi you spend.

#### Fire Stream
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You shoot a continuous stream of fire from their fingertips, fists, palms, or legs, forming a line 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (the DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + your firebending modifier). A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

The stream widens by 5 feet for each additional chi you spend.

#### Create Lightning
*Cost: 3 chi*  
*Prerequisite: 7th level*  
You cast the *Lightning Bolt* spell with a range equal to your bending range.

<!--#### Blocking Fire
#### Blazing Rings and Arcs
