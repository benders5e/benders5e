# Firebender
As the element of power, firebenders have to be able to maintain a constant source of energy and balance in battle, unleashing a volley of direct, successive attacks. 

#### Quick Build
You can make a firebender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Charisma as your highest score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier background. 

## Class Features

As a firebender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per firebender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per firebender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars  
**Tools:** Pai Sho and one of herbalism kits or one musical instrument.
***
**Saving Throws:** Charisma, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Deception, History, Insight, Performance, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- 2 shortswords

### Firebending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to produce fire with your hands and feet. You can spend 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Produce Flame* cantrip. (See "Fire Jab" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks.) Your range increases with your level according to the "Range" column of the Firebender table.

### Fire Jab
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available every time you take the Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). This amount resets every round. As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this number increases.  

When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 fire damage. This damage increases with your firebender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Firebender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column).     


As a firebender, Charisma is your primary attack ability:  


**Attack Bonus** = proficiency + Cha modifier   


**Damage Bonus** = Cha modifier  

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your firebending modifier.

#### Bonus Attack
Firebenders are fierce fighters. Anytime you use your action to make a firebending attack (basic or with a form), you may use your bonus action to make a basic firebending attack.

### Defusion
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your reaction to defuse an attack when you are hit by a ranged non-bending attack or a basic ranged bending attack (not one that is the result of a form or specialized bending). When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by half. Any fire damage is reduced to 0.  

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.  

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options:

#### Dancing Dragon
You practice a defensive and circular type of bending, gaining a +2 to AC.

#### Agni Kai
You are skilled at duels and excel at focusing your power on one opponent. If you attack the same target as your previous attack, you gain a +2 to your attack roll.

#### Chaquan
You are an expert in acrobatics and agile, graceful movements. You gain +5 to your speed and proficiency in Acrobatics. If you already have proficiency, you gain expertise.

<!--#### Shaolin
You are used to fighting in close ranges, utilizing strong kicks and quick punches
Aspects of the firebending combat style can be seen through a similar emphasis on highly technical kicking strikes, fundamentally strong movements, and the usage of swift, direct maneuvers. Northern Shaolin is an external style that uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent.

The Northern Shaolin style emphasizes "kicking over hand fighting", or prioritizing one's legwork as opposed to the arms. Kicks are meant to "extend as far as possible without compromising balance-->

</div> 

#### Seven Stars
You favor a style that utilizes momentary bursts of extreme power at the expense of your defense. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to decrease your AC for the next turn by 2 to add +2 to the damage dealt by all your attacks that hit.  

### Firebending Forms
At 3rd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular forms that combine martial arts and firebending to carry out more sophisticated attacks.  

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Firebender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one. 

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). You can use each form a maximum of once per turn.

#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.   

You have 4 exhaustion points at your disposal. (Use a d4 to keep track.) The d4 starts with the "4" pointing up. Every turn you use all of your chi, you decrement this counter. When the counter indicates a "1", you need to take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions that turn. Any bending concentration is also broken. Every turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1. This counter resets every long rest.  

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
\page 
For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a melee, non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 7th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Second Wind
At 4th level, you gain the ability to reset your chi exhaustion die back to the maximum once per long rest.

### Firebending Specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of firebending: advanced firebending, energy reading, or combustionbending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

### Firestep
At 6th level, you can use flame jets to propel yourself through the air during your turn. You use your normal speed and movement when you fire-step and you must end your turn on the ground.

### ?
At 7th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a basic firebending attack, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. 

### Lightning Redirection
Starting at 9nd level, when someone else shoots lightning at you, you can attempt to redirect it by making a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you can choose to redirect the lightning in any direction of your choice as if you were generating it yourself. On a failure, you take 8d6 lightning damage.

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

> *If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to the shoulder, then down into the stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body; it is called the sea of chi. From your stomach you direct it up again and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical; you must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly.*   
> **–Iroh, inventor of lightning redirection**

#### Fire Augmentation
Beginning at 10th level, you are able to alter the quality of outside sources of fire. On your turn, you can spend a bonus action to put out or triple the size of any fires within your range (excluding fire being produced by another firebender) without moving. 
[check *Prestidigitation*]

<!--div style="height: 6em;">
</div-->
### ???
Beginning at 13th level, ... [Some improved ability or saving throws]

### ???
At 14th level, ... [some flavor-type thing]

### Fire Rockets
At 15th level, the power of your Firestepping increases. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can end your turn in the air without falling.

### Dragonfire
For a long time, disciplines of firebending were taught to be fueled by hatred, as opposed to the original source. At 20th level, you learn of the true nature of firebending: it represents energy and life, not anger and destruction. 

With this knowledge, your fire becomes an extension of your body rather than merely a tool for protection. It becomes beautiful and multi-colored, and anyone who looks at it gains the advantages of the *Guidance* cantrip.

## Firebending Specializations

### Advanced Firebending

#### Colorful Flame 

Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, your fire begins to develop a character of its own. It takes on one of the colors below and the corresponding type of damage. At 5th level, your bending attack deals an additional 1d4 of the damage type determined by your fire's color. At 11th level this increases to 1d6, and again to 1d8 at 17th level.

| Color     | Damage Type   |
|:----------|:--------------|
| Blue      | Lightning     |
| Red-orange| Fire          |
| Green     | Poison or acid|
| Yellow    | Radiant       |
| Black     | Necrotic      |
| White     | Cold          |

#### ?
At 8th level, the power of your inner flame grows, increasing your stamina. You now have 6 chi exhaustion points at your disposal and thus you now use a 1d6 as your chi exhaustion die.

#### ?
At 12th level, ...  
[You get to exclude up to half your advanced level (firebender level minus 10) rounded down creatures from any AOE effects.]

#### Heat Control
At 17th level, you learn to control not only fire, but any heat housed by matter. By touching an object, you can siphon off heat by spending an amount of time that depends on the material (some examples are shown in the table below). You must have one hand on the material and one hand free.  
You can also have the opposite effect: if you have hands or nose or mouth free, you can heat up materials in the vicinity with an action, causing them to reach a temperature equal to the result of being exposed to a hot flame for half an hour. (You cannot use this ability to, for exmaple, heat rock into lava.)

##### Cooling Time
| Material | Minutes              |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Metal    | 1d8                  |
| Lava mass| 1d6                  |


### Lightning-bending

#### ?
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, ...
stunning/shocking/conducting current

#### Create Lightning
At 8th level, you learn to distinguish the yin and yang of energy and separate the positive from the negative energy. This creates an imbalance, and when the energies attempts to restore balance by crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.  

You learn the *Lightning* form described in the "Forms" section at the end of this class description.

#### Lightning Arcs
At 12th level, your lightning attacks have the potential to arc from one target to the next. Whenever you use the *Lightning* form, any creatures within 5 feet of the initial target also become targets, any creatures within 5 feet of them become targets, and so on.

#### ?
At 17th level, ...

### Energy Reading

#### Chi Paths
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to sense the chi paths in people and interpret their spiritual energy. You may use an action to touch a creature and end one disease or condition (blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned) on it. You can also choose to instead confer the benefits of the *Guidance* cantrip on your target.   

***
Additionally, you can sense this energy and heat emanating from creatures even from afar. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect life forms around you. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any warm-blooded life forms within your bending range that are not behind total cover. You know the type (human or beast) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity.

You can use each of these features a number of times equal to your bending modifier. When you finish a Long Rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Healing
At 8th level, you learn to clear blocked chi paths within creatures and redirect their energy towards wounds to speed up the healing process. By spending one minute concentrating on reading the chi paths in another person's body, you heal them by an amount of hit points equal to three times your firebender level. 

#### Mass Heal
At 12th level, ...

#### Minor Energybending
At 17th level, you learn to bend the energy within people's bodies to a limited extent. Once per long rest, you may spend an action to do one of the following:
- End a temporary bending block caused by bloodbending
- Give a target advantage on one skill or saving throw for the next 24 hours
- Increase one creature's hit point maximum by 10 + your firebending modifier for the next 24 hours
- ... (Some kind of buff like *Guidance*)

<!--At 20th level, you gain energybending. It is a highly dangerous technique; if one's own energy is impure and therefore bendable, the practitioner will be consequently destroyed. Energybending allows the user to remove other people's bending abilities; restore them after a bender had their abilities blocked by bloodbending; and use the art to create a spiritual projection.

(Needs more description of mechanics; high stakes if you fail a wisdom saving throw or something.)-->

### Combustionbending
<!--You can blow stuff up with your mind!  
Level ideas: silent, multiple simultaneous projectiles, increasing power/range/radius of blast.-->

#### Mind's Eye
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you can fire bend even if your limbs are restrained as long as your head is free. Because your bending requires no movement, your attacks count as surprise attacks if you have not yet attacked the target in the current combat.

#### Combustion
At 8th level, you can make an explosion as your basic bending attack. Instead of making a firebending attack, you can choose a point within range on which to center an explosion. Targets in a 5-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take your bending damage in force damage, and on a success they take half damage.

#### Advanced Forms
At 12th level, you learn an additional form of your choice from the following list:  

##### Charged Attack

##### Breath of Fire
(stealthy)

#### ???
At 17th level, ...

## Firebending Forms
<!--Mostly offense stuff-->

#### Flaming Armor
*Cost: 1 chi*  
[like Armor of Agathys]

#### Fire Blade
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You narrow and condense your flame projection, creating a thin blade of fire to slice at a target, dealine 1d8 slashing damage + 1d8 fire damage.

#### Sweeping Fire
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You sweep your legs in an arc around you, causing fire to spread out in a 20-foot radius circle with you at the center. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful save. The damage increases by 2d6 with each additional chi you spend.

#### Fire Bomb
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create a flame at the end of one of your limb and thrust it onto the ground in an explosive burst at a point within range. Targets in a 10-foot radius of the burst must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 2d6 force damage and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage. The damage increases by 1d6 with each additional chi spent.

#### Flashbang
*Cost: 2 chi*  
...

#### Fire Daggers
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create two blowtorch-like jets from your fists or fingertips to use as close range melee attacks. As part of the same action used to create them, you can make two attacks dealing 1d4 slashing damage + 1d4 fire  damage.  

The daggers remain as long as you maintain concentration. You can continue to attack with them, each time spending 2 chi to make two hits. You add your damage bonus to the damage of both attacks.  

Despite their slashing capabilities, these daggers lack the ability to block physical objects.

#### Shield of Fire
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You prepare to defuse the next attack that hits you. The next time a creature rolls to attack you and hits, you can use your reaction to raise your AC by 2. If this causes the attack to miss, the shield disintegrates.

<div style="height:7em;">
</div>
#### Fire Lashes
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You shape your flame into a lashing tendril and swipe at a target within range, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage. For each additional chi point you spend, you create and attack with another fire lash, dealing an additional die of damage.

#### Projectiles
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You create and launch 4 miniature fireballs at any combination of targets within your long range (the second number in the "Range" column). These attacks are made without disadvantage. Each fireball deals 1d4 fire damage.   

You gain an additional dagger for each extra chi you spend.

#### Fire Stream
*Cost: 2 chi*  
You shoot a continuous stream of fire from their fingertips, fists, palms, or legs, forming a line 5 feet wide and as long as your bending range. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (the DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + your firebending modifier). A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

The stream widens by 5 feet for each additional chi you spend.

#### Create Lightning
*Prerequisite: Advanced Firebending, 8th level*  
*Cost: 3 chi*  
You cast the *Lightning Bolt* spell with a range equal to your bending range.

<!--#### Blocking Fire
#### Blazing Rings and Arcs
#### Fire Circle
#### Fire jabs
This is the regular attack? Or should this be like Flurry of Blows?
-->

#### Heat Wave
*Cost: 6 chi*  
You cause the ambient temperature to raise to an uncomfortable level within your normal bending range. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, all target suffer one of the following (your choice):
- 1 level of exhaustion (to maximum of level 3)
- Loss of 1 chi exhaustion point

#### Fire Missiles
#### Fire Pinwheel
#### Wall of Flames
