The [Player's Handbook](./rules/phb/general) on this site contains all the rules and mechanics you will need to play a bender! If you've played Dungeons & Dragons before, most of these will be familiar to you. If you're new to D&D, don't fret! Below is a quick-and-dirty guide to getting off the ground. We'll show you how to create a character and give you the basics of how to play the game.

## The Basics

Dungeons & Dragons is role-playing game (RPG), which means players create characters and take on their role in the story. One player serves as the Dungeon Master (DM), who tells the story and acts as a referee. In Benders 5e, we use the term Game Master (GM) instead of DM.

D&D gameplay generally unfolds in the same way:
1. The GM describes the environment.
1. The players describe the actions they'd like to take.
1. The GM determines what happens as a result.

When the success of a player's actions is not guaranteed, the GM will usually ask them to roll a die. Unless otherwise specified, this is a 20-sided die, called a "d20". Other dice follow the same naming convention: a 10-sided die is called a "d10", an 8-sided die a "d8", and so on. This abbreviation is often preceded by the number of dice of that type rolled; for instance, if a player is asked to roll two 6-sided dice, this is referred to as "rolling 2d6".

Dice-rolling usually proceeds as follows:

1. Roll the die/dice and add any modifiers.
1. Add bonuses or penalties, when applicable.
1. Compare the result to a target value.

## Creating a Character

1. **Choose a <a target="_blank" href="./rules/phb/classes">class</a>.**
1. **Determine your ability scores.** There are six ability scores, half of which are "physical" and half of which are "mental". The physical abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution. The mental abilities are Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your GM should let you know how to determine these scores.
1. **Flesh out your character.**
    - Choose a <a target="_blank" href="./rules/phb/backgrounds">background</a>.
    - Decide on other characteristics: name, age, gender, appearance, personality traits, etc.
1. **Assemble your equipment.** Equipment you start with is listed in your class's description. At your GM's discretion, you may be allowed additional pieces of <a target="_blank" href="./rules/phb/equipment">equipment</a>.

## How to Play

Within the basic outline of gameplay described above, there are additional rules and philosophies for gameplay.

#### The Three Pillars of Adventure
D&D gameplay can be broken roughtly into three components: exploration, social interaction, and combat. Many players have a preference for one of these "pillars", and a campaign may emphasize one over the others.
- **Exploration.** This can be anything from going shopping in a village to traveling the wilderness. Any unstructured movement within the game world is considered exploration.
- **Social Interaction.** This is where the "RP" in RPG comes from. Any conversation or interaction with other characters in the world falls under this umbrella. Depending on the players and the GM, the commitment to roleplaying can range from simple third-person narration of actions to character voices, extreme facial expressions, and even moving around in the space.
- **Combat.** When words come to blows, combat rules kick in. These are described briefly in the "Attack Rolls" section.

#### Ability Checks  
Most actions outside of combat will require a player to roll an ability check. The GM specifies what skill or ability the action requires, and the player rolls a d20, adding the appropriate modifier: the ability modifier corresponding to the skill's ability plus the proficiency bonus, if the player is proficient in that skill.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage  
When a player is attempting an action that they should likely succeed in, the GM may ask them to roll with advantage. This means the player rolls the d20 twice and takes the higher of the two rolls. Conversely, if circumstances make success difficult, the GM could impose disadvantage. In this case, the player rolls twice but takes the lower of the two rolls.

#### Attack Rolls  
Attack rolls are a special kind of ability check that occurs in combat to determine whether a player's weapon strikes the specified target. The ability used depends on the weapon (usually Strength, but some weapons use Dexterity). Most of the time, a player is proficient with their weapon, and so also adds the proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack roll exceeds the target's armor class (AC), the attack hits and the player rolls damage (determined by the weapon).

#### Saving Throws  
Saving throws are slightly different from ability checks and attack rolls, because they are not initiated by the player. Instead, a saving throw occurs when a player is forced to react to some external event (so they cannot choose to avoid the roll). In this case, a player adds the appropriate saving throw modifier to a d20 roll in the hopes of beating some threshold determined by the external effect.
