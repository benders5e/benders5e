# Pro Bending

![Pro bending](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/0/0a/Pro-bending_Arena_interior.png)

The rules of pro bending are pretty simple. Take control over the area in a specified amount of time until you either defeat your opponents or win. 

> #### Bending X Leagues
> Leagues with more lax rules exist. In these matches, which are far more dangerous, any manifestation of the elements is allowed, including ice, lightning, magma, plants, and more.

## Rules
*The rules are based off of the rules listed [here](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Pro-bending).*

Each "round" of the game consists of 4 rounds of combat and there are 12 rounds total (3 sets of 4). The ring is divided into two halves, each of which is further divided into three sections. Each section is 30 feet wide. Teams begin the match facing each other in the two sections closest to the center. The goal is to knock the other team back and off the platform.

## Actions
- **Attack:**
    - On a hit, the target takes damage and is knocked back a number of feet equal to the damage.
    - Additionally, when you are reduced to 2/3 of your total HP you are moved back one section, and again when you are reduced to 1/3. (So, when you are at 2/3 health, you move to the 2nd section from the center, and at 1/3 to the last section.)
    - When everyone on one team is knocked out of a section, the other team advances.
    - If a player is knocked to 0 HP, they are knocked back 3 sections (knocking them off the map unless ground was taken).
    - Regaining an area does not restore the corresponding HP.
    - Normal dnd actions that will be at the DM's discretion (?)
- **Move:**
    - You can use your movement to reposition yourself within your zone.
    - If you step over the back of your zone, you forfeit the ground and must move back to that zone. This doesn't apply to the last zone, and you must be knocked off the back edge to be knocked out of the last zone.
    - You cannot move up a zone unless your entire team moves up, which cannot happen without knocking all opposing team members out of the next zone first. 
- **Healing:**
    - Healing is permitted, but it won't move you up a zone. That is, if you drop below 1/3 HP and then heal back up to over 2/3, you can't go back into the first zone.

## Crowd Mechanic
- You can flavor your attacks to try to gain the crowd's favor. Roll a ...
- The crowd can be in a neutral state, a negative state, or a positive state, depending on your team's amount of "crowd points".
    - If you are the first to impress the crowd, you gain a positive point.
    - If the other team impresses the crowd, you lose a point.
    - If you try to impress the crowd and fail, you lose a point.
- Having the crowd on your side gives your team one inspiration point for the round, to give to one player on the team as you see fit.
- At the end, the team who has the crowd the most will split the vote in case of a tie (?)
- **Teamwork:**
    - If your team lands three attacks in one round, you gain advantage on your roll to impress the crowd.

> #### Fouls
> If you commit a foul, you move back one zone. Examples of fouls includes:
> - Hosing
> - Bending an earth disk outside your zone
> - Creating ice
> - Headshots
> - Mixing water and rocks
