# Pro Bending

![Pro bending](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/0/0a/Pro-bending_Arena_interior.png)

The rules of pro bending are pretty simple. Take are of control over the area in a specified amount of time until you either defeat your opponents or win. 

## Rules
*The rules are based off of the rules listed [here](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Pro-bending).*

Each "round" of the game consists of 4 rounds of combat and there are 12 total. Each section has 30 feet of movement and every round will allow you to do a multitude of things but mainly, the goal is to knock the other team back and off the platform.

## Actions:
- Attacking
    - Damage = Ft moved
    - Its based on percentage of hit points. Every 1/3 of your total team hit points moves you back one ring. 
    - When your team is knocked back a full row the team in front of you advances
    - When you go down you are knocked 3 sections back (knocking you off the map unless ground was taken
    - If you knock them back a ring after you’ve been knocked back you regain the area but you do not get more hitpoints
    - If you go to zero you will just be pushed all 3 sections
    - Normal dnd actions that will be at the DM's discretion
- Movement:
    - You can use your movement to reposition yourself within your zone, but this doesn’t help you between moving zones (ie if you get hurt)
- Healing:
    - Healing works, but it won’t move you up into another ring
    - i.e. if you go below 1/3 and then hop up to 2/3 you can’t go back into the one ring.

## Crowd Mechanic:
- You can flavor your attacks to try and gain advantage over the crowd
- The crowd has a neutral state, a negative state, and a positive state
- If you are the first to impress the crowd, you gain a positive point
- If the other team impresses the crowd you lose a point
- If you try to impress the crowd and fail you lose a point
- Having the crowd on your side will give one player on your team inspiration per turn
- At the end, the team who has the crowd the most will split the vote in case of a tie
- Teamwork
    - If your team lands three attacks in one round, you gain advantage on your roll to impress the crowd
