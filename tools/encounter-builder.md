*Note: We are still in the process of adding creatures to the bestiary. If you don't see a creature you want to use, let us know using the <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/H2VMopAN7gtaRrG5A">feedback form</a>!*

#### Bestiary

The bestiary can be accessed in PDF form <a target="_blank" href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ksPLgQJdQSvo">here</a>.

#### Kobold Fight Club integration

*Note: KFC integration is not yet active. Our bestiary is still incomplete, so we haven't published our data sheet to the web yet.*

Our bestiary can be added to <a target="_blank" href="https://kobold.club">Kobold Fight Club</a>, which is an excellent tool for balancing encounters!

1. On Kobold Fight Club, click "Manage Content" in the filters section (top right).
1. Add the bestiary info in the text fields at the bottom:
  - **Name:** Benders 5e
  - **ID:** 1xTJM911PlaG9NB_BVaWclcZAMUOEpxArhLf7CKGP5Bc
1. Click "Add"

Benders 5e creatures are now included in the Kobold Fight Club creature list and can be added, filtered, etc. as normal. <!--To filter out all other creatures, click "Set Sources" and deselect all sources except "Benders 5e" (should be listed under "Community").-->

#### Spreadsheet

If you prefer to have the raw Kobold Fight Club data, a spreadsheet of creature stats is available <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xTJM911PlaG9NB_BVaWclcZAMUOEpxArhLf7CKGP5Bc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
