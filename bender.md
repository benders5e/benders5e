# Bender Campaign Setting
W*ater – Earth – Fire – Air. Long ago, the nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.* 

In his absence, chaos reigns, kept at bay only by brave benders who have taken it upon themselves to fill the void he left...

### The Magic of Chi
Benders make careful study of a magical energy called chi ("ki" by monks). This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse – specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Benders harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of chi in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of chi gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Training
Things about training

>##### Bending Training
> Benders are trained in a variety of ways.
- monks
- self-taught
- original benders
- family members
- travel to a master

### Creating a Bender
As you make your bender character, think about ...
- The culture of your nation: did you grow up in the nation of your bending element? If not, your style may be very different from that of a bender raised by their element's culture (e.g. Zaheer as an airbender)
- How you began training in bending. Were your parents benders? Siblings? When did you first learn of your abilities? Who became your bending master?
- Why did you leave your home?

The element you bend and the type of training you underwent has a great impact on benders' alignments. Think about the type of environment you grew up in, and how that might manifest itself. As a rule of thumb, fire and air are more chaotic elements, while earth is lawful.

### 5e Skills Modifications
This class uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- No Arcana
- Replace Religion (Int) with Spirituality (Wis) *[not propagated through classes yet]*

### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional lanauge, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument.

### Opportunity Attacks
Benders can spend a maximum of 1 chi on their opportunity attacks.

### Planes of Existence
#### Material
#### Spirit World
There's spirits there.

<!--## Bracers of Defense
*Uncommon item*

+1 to AC

## Fans
Taking your fans out or putting them away takes a bonus action. Opening or closing them does as well. You can still earthbend while holding the fans; they augment your bending, increasing your range by 10 feet.

## Glider
Opening or closing your glider takes a bonus action.  

When holding the glider in the closed position, you can use it to channel your bending as if it were a free hand.  

When the glider is open, you can use it to fly. Flying requires airbending, so only airbenders will be able to use a glider to fly. An airbender using a glider has a flying speed of  60 ft. Your hands and feet are both occupied when gliding, so if you use them to bend or for another action you must let go of the glider. If you let go with one hand, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or lose control of the glider.

You can attempt to carry at most one other person besides yourself on the glider. In this case, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or lose control.

<!--## Pai Sho Board
### Special White Lotus Tile
Get room and board at any friendly house

## Space Sword
Longsword, special.
-->
## Spirit Water
When used by a waterbender for healing, it restores double the amount of HP granted by regular healing.

## Water pouch
A water pouch holds the equivalent of a 1-foot-diameter sphere of water. It is typically worn on the waist and can be used for waterbending when no water source is within range.

### Notes about using the bender class

- This class is meant to be played in a world in which the only race is Human.
- Do not use in combination with any magical D&D classes; so, you can play a Bender in a party with Barbarians, Fighters, Monks, or Rogues, but no others.
