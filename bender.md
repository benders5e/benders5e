# Bender Campaign Setting
W*ater – Earth – Fire – Air. Long ago, the nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.* 

In his absence, chaos reigns, kept at bay only by brave benders who have taken it upon themselves to fill the void he left...

### Classes

- The four types of Benders (Water, Earth, Fire, Air)
- Modified Monk (with new Chi Blocker monastic tradition)
- Barbarian, Fighter, and Rogue as in the Player's Handbook

### Skills
This class uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- No Arcana
- Replace Religion (Int) with Spirituality (Wis) *[not propagated through classes yet]*

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional lanauge, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument.

### Opportunity Attacks
Benders can spend a maximum of 1 chi on their opportunity attacks.

<div style="height:2em;">
</div>

> ##### Underwater Combat
> The usual [D&D 5e underwater combat rules](https://dnd5e.info/combat/underwater-combat/) apply. More specifically, for bending attacks and forms, the following rules apply:  
> - **Waterbending:** Advantage on attack rolls; normal damage.  
> - **Firebending:** Disadvantage on ranged attacks, regular roll for touch range. In each case, the attack does half damage if it is dealt underwater (since fully immersed creatures have resistance against fire damage).  
> - **Earth- & Airbending:** Disadvantage on melee and ranged attacks within normal range (automatic miss beyond normal range); half damage.

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

> ##### Nonlethal Damage
> - For **melee attacks**, only slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.
> - For **ranged attacks**, only bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.  
> 
> (Thus, for the most part, firebenders are unable to deliver nonlethal attacks.)
<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

### Planes of Existence
#### Physical World

The physical world, sometimes also called the material world, is the plane of existence on which humans live.

#### Spirit World
There's spirits there.

### Celestial Tracking Variant

If your party wishes to accurately track the passage of time and position of the celestial bodies to account for their effects on benders and spirits, your DM can calculate these positions according to the following rules.  

These rules are optional.

- **General simplifications.** For simplicity of calculations, many numbers have been rounded. A year consists of 12 30-day months or 360 days.

- **Phases of the Moon.** In this setting, the period of the lunar phases (the synodic month) is rounded to 30 days and begins with the new moon. The phases are broken down as follows: 
  - 1 day new moon (day 1),
  - 7 days waxing crescent (days 2-8),
  - 1 day first quarter (day 9),
  - 6 days waxing gibbous (days 10-15),
  - 1 day full moon (day 16),
  - 6 days waning gibbous (days 17-22),
  - 1 day last quarter (day 23),
  - 7 days waning crescent (days 24-30),
  - 1 day new moon (day 1 of the next cycle).  
  

Whether the moon is out during the day or night depends on its phase.
- New moon: during the day <!-- waxing crescent: during the majority of end of the day, minority of beginning of the night -->
- First quarter: during the second half of the day and the first half of the night <!-- waxing gibbous: during the minority of end of the day, majority of beginning of the night -->
- Full: during the night <!-- waning gibbous: during majority of end of the night, minority of beginning of the day -->
- Last quarter: during the second half of the night and the first half of the day <!-- waning crescent: minority of end of night, majority of beginning of the day -->

Waterbenders are strengthened as the moon grows fuller, reaching their peak during the full moon.
- **Eclipses.** Solar eclipses always occur during a new moon, and lunar eclipses during a full moon. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse, and waterbenders lose theirs during a lunar eclipse.

- **Comets.** Individual comets are periodic, but on the whole, the passing of a comet does not follow a periodic pattern and as such it is the prerogative of the DM when a comet passes. Comets strengthen firebenders.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | INTRODUCTION</div>

\page

- **Day and Night.** Firebenders are stronger during the day, when the sun is out. Waterbenders are strengthened by the moon (which may be out during either the day or the night). The relative length of day and night varies based on the season and latitude.

- **Solstices.** On the summer and winter solstice (day 16 of the 6th and 12th month, respecitvely), the physical and spirit world are at their closest. Spirits can pass into the physical world without passing through a portal. Conversely, it is most difficult to pass between the worlds without assistance during the equinoxes (which fall on day 16 of the 3rd and 9th month, respectively).

- **Harmonic Convergence.** Every 1000 years, the planets in the solar system align. During this alignment, the physical world and the spirit world are separated by nothing more than a thin veil, even closer than on the solstices.

<!--## Bracers of Defense
*Uncommon item*

+1 to AC
-->
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Boomerang._** 
You can make both melee and ranged attacks with a boomerang. When thrown for a ranged attack, the boomerang returns to your hand unscathed at the beginning of your next turn.

**_Fans._** 
Taking your fans out or putting them away takes a bonus action. Opening or closing them does as well. You can still earthbend while holding the fans; they augment your bending, increasing your range by 10 feet.

**_Glider._**
Opening or closing your glider takes a bonus action. When holding the glider in the closed position, you can use it to channel your bending as if it were a free hand.  

When the glider is open, you can use a bonus action to fly. Flying requires airbending, so only airbenders will be able to use a glider to fly. You must use 5 feet of ground movement to take off, at which point you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. 

Your hands and feet are both occupied when gliding, so if you use them to bend or for another action you must let go of the glider. If you let go with one hand, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control of the glider.

You can attempt to carry another other person in addition to you on the glider. In this case, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control. The DC increases by 3 with each additional person on the glider.

<!--div style="height:4em;">
</div-->
**_Guanmao Hat._**
This large-brimmed hat is flat and shield-like, allowing the wearer to defuse various attacks by lowering their head. It confers +1 to AC.

**_Hooked Swords._**
On a hit, you can make an opposed Dexterity check against the target's Strength. On a success, the target is disarmed and its weapon clatters to the ground in the nearest empty space (your choice if there are multiple options). If the target is wielding more than one weapon, only one of them falls to the ground.

**_Spirit Water._**
When used by a waterbender for healing, it restores double the amount of HP granted by healing with regular water.

**_Water pouch._**
A water pouch holds the equivalent of a 1-foot-diameter sphere of water. It is typically worn on the waist and can be used for waterbending when no water source is within range.

</div>

### Elemental Parry

You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:
• You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
• If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one superiority die, which is a d6. This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest

You've become adept at fighting benders of a particular element of your choice. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn the following two combat maneuvers, which are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. 

<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**_Parry._** When a bender of your chosen element damages you with a melee attack that is not the result of a bending specialization, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your superiority die.
**_Defusion._** When a bender of your chosen element damages you with a ranged attack that is not the result of a bending specialization, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to defuse the attack, reducing the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
</div>

- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one superiority die, which is a d6. This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

### Fortuneteller
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can cast the spell *Augury* at will (you must have the necessary material components). 

### Teamaker
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks identifying whether leaves or herbs can be used to brew tea.
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks when foraging for tea leaves.
- Once per long rest, if you have tea leaves or herbs available, you can create an infusion laced with healing power. Any creature who drinks it gains the benefits of a Potion of Healing. Drinking more than once from the infusion does not confer any additional benefits.

### Resourceful Bender
*Prerequisite: the ability to bend an element*  

***
Your ingenuity and experience with a variety of adversaries have allowed you to adapt another element's fightning style and make it your own. Pick one form from another element-bender's form list (not one that requires a bending specialization). You can add this form to your list of known forms, and it doesn't count against the total number of forms you know (as indicated by the "Forms Known" column of the Bender Table).

When you use this form, you adapt it to use your element instead of the original element, causing it do deal your element's damage type instead of the original damage type. You also use your bending modifiers and DCs.

### Martial Bender
*Prerequisite: the ability to bend an element*   

***
You've learned to use your bending in conjunction with weapons when you fight. When you use the Attack action with a melee weapon on your turn, you can make basic bending attack as part of the same attack.

# Backgrounds

<p></p>

Some backgrounds are nation-specific. Backgrounds that can only be taken by Benders (of the corresponding element) are marked with an asterisk.

## All Classes
These backgrounds can be taken by any class.

### Regular D&D 5e Backgrounds
*Source: Player's Handbook*  
<div style='column-count:2'>
  
- Charlatan
- Criminal
- Entertainer
- Folk Hero
- Guild Artisan
- Hermit
- Noble
- Outlander
- Sage
- Sailor
- Soldier
- Urchin
</div>

### Faction Agent
*Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*  
<!--"Faction Agent" background in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide-->
***
You are a member of a secret order, such as the Order of the White Lotus or the Order of the red Lotus.

***
**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, appropriate to your faction 
**Tool Proficiencies:** Pai sho set, disguise kit  
**Equipment:** Badge or emblem of your faction (for example a white lotus pai sho tile), a copy of a seminal faction text (or code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

***
#### Feature: Safe Haven
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.

<div style="height: 8em;">
</div>

### Cloistered Scholar  
*Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*  
<!--https://5ebackgrounds.com/cloistered-scholar/ -->

***
**Skill Proficiencies:**  History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Any two of your choice  
**Equipment:** The scholar's robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Library Access
Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy to a fellow scholar.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth - perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.

### Fisher
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  
<!--https://ghostsofsaltmarsh-9.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/saltmarsh-backgrounds -->
***
**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice  
**Equipment:** Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp
***
**Other Proficiencies:** Swim speed 30 feet  

#### Feature: Harvest the Water
You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 4 | BACKGROUNDS</div>

\page

#### Fishing Tale
You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale.

| d8 | Tale |
|:---|:-------------|
| 1  | **Lobster Wrestling.** You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster. |
| 2  | **It Dragged the Boat.** You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles. |
| 3  | **Fins of Pure Gold.** You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it. |
| 4  | **Ghost Fish.** You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see. |
| 5  | **Nemesis Clam.** A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you'll find that clam. |
| 6  | **It Swallowed the Sun.** You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night. |
| 7  | **Dive into the Abyss.** You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since. |
| 8  | **Love Story.** You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically. |

#### Suggested Characteristics
Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.

##### Fisher Personality Traits
| d8 | Personality Trait
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I am unmoved by the wrath of nature.
| 2  | My friends are my crew; we sink or float together.
| 3  | I need long stretches of quiet to clear my head.
| 4  | Rich folk don't know the satisfaction of hard work.

<div style="height: 9em;">
</div>

##### Fisher Ideals
| d6 | Ideal
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | **Camaraderie.** Good people make even the longest voyage bearable. (Good)
| 2  | **Luck.** Our luck depends on respecting its rules—now throw this salt over your shoulder. (Lawful)
| 3  | **Daring.** The richest bounty goes to those who risk everything. (Chaotic)
| 4  | **Plunder.** Take all that you can and leave nothing for the scavengers. (Evil)
| 5  | **Balance.** Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you. (Neutral)
| 6  | **Hard Work.** No wave can move a soul hard at work. (Any)

##### Fisher Bonds
| d6 | Bond
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I lost something important in the deep sea, and I intend to find it.
| 2  | Someone else's greed destroyed my livelihood, and I will be compensated.
| 3  | I will fish the many famous waters of this land.
| 4  | The spirits saved me during a terrible storm, and I will honor their gift.
| 5  | My destiny awaits me at the bottom of a particular pond in the Spiritwilds.
| 6  | I must repay my village's debt.

##### Fisher Flaws
| d6 | Flaw
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I am judgmental, especially of those I deem homebodies or otherwise lazy.
| 2  | I become depressed and anxious if I'm away from the sea too long.
| 3  | I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others.
| 4  | I am inclined to tell long-winded stories at inopportune times.
| 5  | I work hard, but I play harder.
| 6  | I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits.

### Marine
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  
<!--https://ghostsofsaltmarsh-9.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/saltmarsh-backgrounds -->
***
**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water, land)   
**Equipment:** A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of your ship or company, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp
***
**Other Proficiencies:** Swim speed 30 feet  

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 4 | BACKGROUNDS</div>

\page

#### Feature: Steady
You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see "Travel Pace" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.

#### Hardship Endured
Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.

| d6 | Hardship
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | **Nearly Drowned.** You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence.
| 2  | **Captured.** You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.
| 3  | **Sacrifice.** You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you're dead.
| 4  | **Juggernaut.** No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory.
| 5  | **Stowaway.** For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.
| 6  | **Leave None Behind.** You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.

##### Marine Personality Traits
| d8 | Personality Trait
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I speak rarely but mean every word I say.
| 2  | I laugh loudly and see the humor in stressful situations.
| 3  | I prefer to solve problems without violence, but I finish fights decisively.
| 4  | I enjoy being out in nature; poor weather never sours my mood.
| 5  | I am dependable.
| 6  | I am always working on some project or other.
| 7  | I become cantankerous and quiet in the rain.
| 8  | When the sea is within my sight, my mood is jovial and optimistic.

##### Marine Ideals
| d6 | Ideal
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | **Teamwork.** Success depends on cooperation and communication. (Good)
| 2  | **Code.** The marines' code provides a solution for every problem, and following it is imperative. (Lawful)
| 3  | **Embracing.** Life is messy. Throwing yourself into the worst of it is necessary to get the job done. (Chaotic)
| 4  | **Might.** The strong train so that they might rule those who are weak. (Evil)
| 5  | **Bravery.** To act when others quake in fear—this is the essence of the warrior. (Any)
| 6  | **Perseverance.** No injury or obstacle can turn me from my goal. (Any)

##### Marine Bonds
| d6 | Bond
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I face danger and evil to offset an unredeemable act in my past.
| 2  | I. Will. Finish. The. Job.
| 3  | I must set an example of hope for those who have given up.
| 4  | I'm searching for a fellow marine captured by an elusive enemy.
| 5  | Fear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated.
| 6  | My commander betrayed my unit, and I will have revenge.

##### Marine Flaws
| d6 | Flaw
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I grow combative and unpredictable when I drink.
| 2  | I find civilian life difficult and struggle to say the right thing in social situations.
| 3  | My intensity can drive others away.
| 4  | I hold grudges and have difficulty forgiving others.
| 5  | I become irrational when innocent people are hurt.
| 6  | I sometimes stay up all night listening to the ghosts of my fallen enemies.

### Shipwright
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh*  
<!--https://ghostsofsaltmarsh-9.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/saltmarsh-backgrounds -->
***
**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Perception  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Carpenter's tools, Vehicles (water)  
**Equipment:** A set of well-loved carpenter's tools, a blank book, 1 ounce of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler's clothes, and a leather pouch with 10 gp
***

#### Feature: I'll Patch It!
Provided you have carpenter's tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 4 | BACKGROUNDS</div>

\page

#### Life at Sea
Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character.

| d6 | Sea's Influence
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | **Grand Designs.** You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design.
| 2  | **Solid and Sound.** You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend.
| 3  | **Favored.** You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel's hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant's distant mansion.
| 4  | **Master of Armaments.** You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items.
| 5  | **Low Places.** You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals' ships in exchange for coin and favors.
| 6  | **Mysteries of the Deep.** You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous.

##### Shipwright Personality Traits
| d8 | Personality Trait
|:---|:-----------------------------------
| 1  | I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen.
| 2  | I'm extremely fond of puzzles.
| 3  | I thrive under pressure.
| 4  | I love sketching and designing objects, especially boats.
| 5  | I'm not afraid of hard work—in fact, I prefer it.
| 6  | A pipe, an ale, and the smell of the sea: paradise.

##### Sand spout
*Cost: X chi*  
...
  
##### Sandstorm
*Cost: 4 chi*  
You raise the sand around you and launch it into the air, creating a sandstorm that fills a cylinder  centered on you with radius and height equal to your bending range. Creatures in the area are blinded and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the sand enters their lungs and they suffer 1 level of exhaustion (to a maximum of level 1).

The sandstorm lasts until the start of your next turn.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a desert-dweller.

## Air
### \*Air Nomad

Air Nomad children are raised in Air Nomad temples from a young age, developing parental bonds with the nomad assigned to their training. A large part of this training is spiritual, which leads to all Air Nomads realizing their connection to their inner chi and unlocking the ability to airbend.

#### Feature: Meditation
Air Nomads don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that others do from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the tables for the hermit background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate.

When choosing your ideal, keep in mind that the Air Nomads are a peaceful people who eschew violence of all sorts and thus tend to a neutral or good alignment.

# Appendix

### Using the Bender setting

This class is meant to be played in a world in which the only race is Human and in which the typical arcane magic is replaced with spirit magic. As such, it was not meant to be played in combination with any magical D&D classes.

If you want to include this class in a regular D&D 5e campaign, at 6th level bending attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

A custom character sheet that reflects the modifications made to regular 5e abilities, skills, etc. can be found [here](https://).
