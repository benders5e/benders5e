# Bender Campaign Setting
W*ater – Earth – Fire – Air. Long ago, the nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.* 

In his absence, chaos reigns, kept at bay only by brave benders who have taken it upon themselves to fill the void he left...

### Classes

- The four types of Benders (Water, Earth, Fire, Air)
- Modified Monk (with Chi Blocker monastic tradition)
- Rogue
- Modified Fighter (with Kyoshi Warrior and Swordmaster subclasses)

<!--#### Kyoshi Warrior
Modified Fighter, uses fans; with specific bending attack defusion maneuvers

#### Swordmaster
Modified Fighter (Samurai or Battlemaster), similar to Sokka's training; with specific bending attack defusion maneuvers.-->

### Skills
This class uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- No Arcana
- Replace Religion (Int) with Spirituality (Wis) *[not propagated through classes yet]*

<!--div style="height: 1em;">
</div-->
### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional lanauge, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument.

### Opportunity Attacks
Benders can spend a maximum of 1 chi on their opportunity attacks.

<div style="height:2em;">
</div>

> ##### Underwater Combat
> The usual [D&D 5e underwater combat rules](https://dnd5e.info/combat/underwater-combat/) apply. More specifically, for bending attacks, the following rules apply:  
> - **Waterbending:** Advantage on attack rolls; normal damage.  
> - **Firebending:** Disadvantage on ranged attacks, regular roll for touch range. In each case, the attack does half damage if it is dealt underwater (since fully immersed creatures have resistance against fire damage).  
> - **Earth- & Airbending:** Disadvantage on melee and ranged attacks within normal range (automatic miss beyond normal range); half damage.

<div style="height: 2em;">
</div>

### Planes of Existence
#### Material
#### Spirit World
There's spirits there.

### Celestial Tracking Variant

- **Phases of the Moon.**
- **Eclipses.**
- **Comets.**
- **Day and Night.**
- **Harmonic Convergence.**

<div style="height:3em;">
</div>

> ##### Nonlethal Damage
> - For **melee attacks**, only slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.
> - For **ranged attacks**, only bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.  
> 
> (Thus, for the most part, firebenders are unable to deliver nonlethal attacks.)

</div>

<!--## Bracers of Defense
*Uncommon item*

+1 to AC
-->

## Boomerang
It always comes back :')

## Fans
Taking your fans out or putting them away takes a bonus action. Opening or closing them does as well. You can still earthbend while holding the fans; they augment your bending, increasing your range by 10 feet.

## Glider
Opening or closing your glider takes a bonus action. When holding the glider in the closed position, you can use it to channel your bending as if it were a free hand.  

When the glider is open, you can use a bonus action to fly. Flying requires airbending, so only airbenders will be able to use a glider to fly. You must use 5 feet of ground movement to take off, at which point you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. 

Your hands and feet are both occupied when gliding, so if you use them to bend or for another action you must let go of the glider. If you let go with one hand, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control of the glider.

You can attempt to carry another other person in addition to you on the glider. In this case, you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose control. The DC increases by 3 with each additional person on the glider.

## Guanmao Hat
This large-brimmed hat is flat and shield-like, allowing the wearer to defuse various attacks by lowering their head. It confers +1 to AC.

<div style="height:7em;">
</div>
## Hooked Swords
On a hit, you can make an opposed Dexterity check against the target's Strength. On a success, the target is disarmed and its weapon clatters to the ground in the nearest empty space (your choice if there are multiple options). If the target is wielding more than one weapon, only one of them falls to the ground.

<!--## Pai Sho Board
### Special White Lotus Tile
Get room and board at any friendly house
-->

## Spirit Water
When used by a waterbender for healing, it restores double the amount of HP granted by healing with regular water.

## Water pouch
A water pouch holds the equivalent of a 1-foot-diameter sphere of water. It is typically worn on the waist and can be used for waterbending when no water source is within range.

# Appendix

### Using the Bender setting

This class is meant to be played in a world in which the only race is Human and in which the typical arcane magic is replaced with spirit magic. As such, it was not meant to be played in combination with any magical D&D classes.

If you want to include this class in a regular D&D 5e campaign, at 6th level bending attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

A custom character sheet that reflects the modifications made to regular 5e abilities, skills, etc. can be found [here](https://).
