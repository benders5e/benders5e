## About this Setting

Changes to the classic D&D 5e rules are marked with the<span class="change"></span> badge, while completely new rules are indicated by the<span class="new"></span> badge.

### Skills
This setting uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- Arcana has been removed
- Religion (Int) has been replaced by Spirituality (Wis)

### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional language, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument. The backgrounds on this site have been adjusted to take this change into account.
