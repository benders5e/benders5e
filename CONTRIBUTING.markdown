## Opening an Issue

- Before opening an issue, make sure a similar issue doesn't already exist.
- Use a descriptive title. If your issue falls into one of the following categories, please add the correct prefix to the title.  

**Problem type:**
  - `[MISSING]` - some ability/rule is missing from the site
  - `[INCOMPLETE]` - the ability/rule is there, but its description is incomplete
  - `[BALANCE]` - class balance issues (damage output, etc.)  

**Idea:** Fairly self-explanatory; the prefix indicates the type of idea.
  - `[ABILITY]` - idea for an ability
  - `[BACKGROUND]` - idea for a background
  - `[FEAT]` - idea for a feat
  - `[FORM]` - idea for a form
  - `[ITEM]` - idea for an item
  - `[MECHANIC]` - idea for some other mechanic

## Submitting a Pull Request

- It's a good idea to discuss proposed changes [in an issue](#opening-an-issue) before working on a pull request (PR). 
- Give your PR a descriptive title and include as many details as possible.
