# Monk

Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

### The Magic of Ki
Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Training and Asceticism
Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.

The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack 
- 10 darts

### Unarmored Defense
<!--*[also Airbender]*  -->
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the Weapons section.

### Chi
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of chi. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of chi points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Chi Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various chi features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more chi features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a chi point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chi back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your chi points.

Some of your chi features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

***
**Chi save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 chi point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Unarmored Movement
<!--*[also Airbender]*  -->
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

### Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

<!--div style="height:0em;">
</div-->
### Deflect Missiles
<!--*[also Airbender (as form, no re-throwing)]*  -->
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 chi point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Slow Fall
<!--*[also Airbender (slightly modified, "Air Cushion")]*  -->
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of chi in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 chi point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Chi-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion
<!--*[also Airbender (9th level)]*  -->
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind
<!--*[also Airbender (Advanced Specialization, 5th level)]*  -->
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body
At 10th level, your mastery of the chi flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### ?
Starting at 13th level, [utility to replace Tongue of Sun and Moon]

### Diamond Soul
<!--*[also Airbender (13th level)]*  -->
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of chi grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 chi point to reroll it and take the second result.

### Timeless Body
<!--*[also Airbender (14th level)]*  -->
At 15th level, your chi sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### ?
Beginning at 18th level, [combat utility to replace Empty Body]

### Perfect Self
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no chi points remaining, you regain 4 chi points.

## Monastic Traditions
Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

### Way of the Open Hand
Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate chi to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

#### Open Hand Technique
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s chi when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Wholeness of Body
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

#### Tranquility
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 chi points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

### Way of the Chi
Monks of the Way of the Chi possess a deep understanding of the flow of chi in the body and learn to interfere with it in their enemies. They learn to identify pressure points and techniques to block chi in their targets, dealing light but deadly strikes, weakening their opponents, and even causing them to temporarily lose their bending. 

#### Precise Strike
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to use your knowledge of pressure points to augment your attacks by attacking a target's weak points. Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 chi point to attack the target's exposed weak point(s). On a hit, you deal the attack's full damage and the target is placed under the effects of the *Bane* spell, subtracting your martial arts die (instead of a 1d4) from its attack rolls for the next minute.

#### ?
*[Adapted from [Way of the Ki Blocker subclass](https://dandwiki.com/wiki/Way_of_the_Ki_Blocker_(5e_Subclass\))]*  
At 6th level, you learn to use pressure points to disrupt the flow of chi and, consequently, certain bodily functions. Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 chi point to cause one of the following effects:

<!--If the part of the body you target does not exist on a certain creature or cannot be reached, the attempt fails.-->

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

\page 

***
**Head:** On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
***
**Neck:** On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all attacks until the end of their next turn.
***
**Arm:** On a hit, the creature must make a Strength saving throw or drop 1 held item of your choice.
***
**Chest:** On a hit, the creature suffers disadvantage on their next saving throw.
***
**Leg:** On a hit, the creature must make a Strength saving throw or fall prone.

#### Chi Blocking
Beginning at 11th level, you learn to use yoru strikes to completely block the flow of chi in your opponents for a short period of time. Whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 chi points to impose one of the following effects on your target:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have its Strength or Dexterity reduced to 0 (setting the modifier to -5) for the next minute
- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or lose its bending for the next minute

#### Energybending
At 17th level, you gain energybending. It is a highly dangerous technique; if one's own energy is impure and therefore bendable, the practitioner will be consequently destroyed. Energybending allows the user to remove other people's bending abilities or restore them after a bender had their abilities blocked by bloodbending.

##### Removing Bending Abilities
Once per long rest, if a bender is Restrained or Incapacitated, you can touch them on the center of the forehead and attempt to remove their bending permanently. 

You must make a special saving throw to determine whether you creep closer to destruction or maintain clarity of your chi. Use your action to roll a contested Charisma saving throw against the target. If you don't have proficiency with Charisma saving throws, you do for this purpose. If your roll matches or exceed's the target's, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. 

A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you succeed in removing your target's bending. On your third failure, you instead gain your target's alignment and drop to 0 hit points. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. 

The number of both is reset to zero when you succeed or fail to remove a target's bending. The successes and failures count on a per-target basis (that is, if you attempt to use this ability on a new target before finishing with another, you start back at zero successes and failures for the second target.)

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a charisma saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you succeed in removing the target's bending.

##### Restoring Bending Abilities
Once per long rest, you can use your action to end a temporary bending block (e.g. one caused by bloodbending or chi blocking).

### Way of Shadow
Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.

#### Shadow Arts
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your chi to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 chi points to cast *Darkness*, *Darkvision*, *Pass without Trace*, or *Silence*, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the *Minor Illusion* cantrip if you don't already know it.

#### Shadow Step
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

#### Cloak of Shadows
By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.

#### Opportunist
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.
