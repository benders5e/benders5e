The rules of pro bending are pretty simple: take control over the area in a specified amount of time until you either defeat your opponents or win.

## Rules

The ring is divided into two halves, each of which is further divided into three zones. A central circle is used only for tie-breakers. Each zone is 30 feet wide. The sides of the ring are usually blocked with ropes, leaving only the back of each side (the left and right extremes in the picture above) open.

Teams begin the match facing each other in the two zones closest to the center (starting positions are marked with red X's; the teams each choose the order of their members). The goal is to knock the other team back and off the platform. ([Link to map with 5-foot grid](/assets/Bending_Arena_grid.jpg).)

The ring is lined with trenches of water between the zones and around the ring, which provide enough material for waterbenders. Additionally, it is dotted with earthen disks (in yellow) for the earthbenders.

### Game Structure

Each set (referred to as a "round") of the game consists of 3 rounds of combat. There are 9 rounds total (3 sets of 3).
- Players take their places in the starting positions. The match proceeds in initiative order.
- When the time expires, whichever team has advanced into the opposite side of the ring wins the set.
- If a round is tied, the tie is resolved by a 1-on-1 face-off. A coin toss is performed, and the team that wins the coin toss chooses an element for the 1-on-1, which takes place entirely in the central circle of the ring. 
- If all players on a team are KO'd (knocked completely off the back of the platform), the other team wins the entire match.

### Actions
- **Attack:**
    - On a hit, the target takes damage and is knocked back a number of feet equal to the damage.
    - Additionally, when you are reduced to 2/3 of your total HP you are moved back one zone, and again when you are reduced to 1/3. This movement does _not_ stack with movement from damage. (For example, when a player with 60 HP takes 40 damage, the player is knocked back two zones only instead of two zones + 40 feet = 3 zones.)
    - When everyone on one team is knocked out of a zone, each player on the other team advances one zone.
    - If a player is knocked to 0 HP, they are knocked back 3 zones. If they remain remain in the ring, they are considered out of the fight until they are healed.
    - Regaining an area does not restore the corresponding HP.
    - [Here's a tool](/tools/pro-bending) to keep track of when players get knocked back.
- **Move:**
    - You can use your movement to reposition yourself within your zone.
    - If you step over the back of your zone, you forfeit the ground and must move back to that zone. This doesn't apply to the last zone, and you must be knocked off the back edge to be knocked out of the last zone.
    - You cannot move up a zone unless your entire team moves up, which cannot happen without knocking all opposing team members out of the next zone first. 
- **Healing:**
    - Healing is permitted, but it won't move you up a zone. That is, if you drop below 1/3 HP and then heal back up to over 2/3, you can't go back into the first zone.
- **Other:** Other D&D actions, such as Dodge, Hide, Help, etc. are also allowed at the GM's discretion.

> #### Fouls
> If you commit a foul, you move back one zone. Examples of fouls in pro bending include:
> - Hosing (bending a water stream at an opponent for an excessively long time)
> - Bending an earth disk outside your zone
> - Creating ice
> - Headshots
> - Mixing water and rocks
> - Grappling
> - Stepping outside your zone
> - Knocking an opponent off the side of the ring (instead of the back)
> 
> Extreme conduct may lead to a yellow fan as a warning, or even a red fan and expulsion.

### Face-off
In case of a tie, the round is resolved by a 1-on-1 fight. In addition to the actions above, the two players in this face-off can switch sides and grapple each other. Whoever knocks the other player out of the central zone first wins the tie-breaker. A player is knocked out of the central circle, giving the opposite team the win, if they are pushed out of the zone by the effects of an attack or if their HP is reduced by 1/3 of their total HP or to 0 HP, whichever comes first.

### Crowd Mechanic
- Each round, one player on each team can flavor an attack to try to gain the crowd's favor. The players roll contesting Charisma (Performance) checks.

- The crowd can be in a neutral state, a negative state, or a positive state, depending on your team's amount of "crowd points". A team can have at most +3 and at minimum -3 crowd points. (If you have +3 points and gain a point, you stay at +3, and vice versa: if you are at -3 and lose a point, you stay at -3.)
    - The team with the winner of the contested Performance check gains a crowd point, and the other team loses a point.
    - Because one team's loss is the other team's gain, the two teams' crowd points always sum to 0.

<blockquote class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The firebender Jian-Yang uses the <span class="ital">Projectiles</span> form to make three quick attacks at an opponent. He wants to make it look very impressive, so he decides to launch them in midair as he performs a forward flip, launching the first two from each of his feet as he flips and the last one with his right fist as he lands.</p>

<p>To complete this feat, he rolls a Performance check. The check will be contested by a player on the opposite team. At the end of the combat round, if Jian-Yang wins the check, the crowd is most impressed with his attack and his team gains a crowd point. On a failure, his performance is lackluster (maybe he stumbles on the landing) and the crowd is disappointed. His team loses a crowd point.</p>
</blockquote>

- Having the crowd on your side gives your team one inspiration point for the round, to give to one player on the team as you see fit.
- **Teamwork:**
    - If your team lands three attacks in one round, you gain advantage on your roll to impress the crowd.

## Bending X Leagues
Leagues with more lax rules exist. In these far more dangerous matches, any manifestation of the elements is allowed, including ice, lightning, magma, plants, and more. Raw materials the benders cannot create themselves, such as plants and metal, are provided.

Furthermore, the list of fouls in Bending X is significantly shorter:

> #### Bending X Fouls
> - Stepping outside your zone
> - Knocking an opponent off the side of the ring (instead of the back)
