<h3 class="change">Tracking Time</h3>

A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for the critical events that shake up the world. For simple time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers spend on their travels and various activities. The calendar tells you when the seasons change and the lunar cycle, and the position of celestial bodies affects benders and spirits. Additionally, you can use your calendar to track important festivals and holidays, as well as key events that shape your campaign. 

<h4 class="new">Celestial Tracking Variant</h4>

If you don't want to have to hunt down the relevant celestial events on a real-world calendar, you can use the following simplified rules to keep track of important celestial events. Numbers have been rounded for simplicity, but because they don't line up with each other, there is still variety in when they overlap.


A widget to help you keep track can be found [here](/tools).

- **General simplifications.** For simplicity of calculations, many numbers have been rounded. A year consists of 12 30-day months or 360 days.

- **Phases of the Moon.** In this setting, the period of the lunar phases (the synodic month) is rounded to 30 days and begins with the new moon. The phases are broken down as follows: 
  - 1 day new moon (day 1),
  - 7 days waxing crescent (days 2-8),
  - 1 day first quarter (day 9),
  - 6 days waxing gibbous (days 10-15),
  - 1 day full moon (day 16),
  - 6 days waning gibbous (days 17-22),
  - 1 day last quarter (day 23),
  - 7 days waning crescent (days 24-30),
  - 1 day new moon (day 1 of the next cycle).  
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
Whether the moon is out during the day or night depends on its phase.
  <ul>
    <li>New moon: during the day</li>
    <!-- waxing crescent: during the majority of end of the day, minority of beginning of the night -->
    <li>First quarter: during the second half of the day and the first half of the night</li>
    <!-- waxing gibbous: during the minority of end of the day, majority of beginning of the night -->
    <li>Full: during the night</li>
    <!-- waning gibbous: during majority of end of the night, minority of beginning of the day -->
    <li>Last quarter: during the second half of the night and the first half of the day</li>
    <!-- waning crescent: minority of end of night, majority of beginning of the day -->
  </ul>
Waterbenders are strengthened as the moon grows fuller, reaching their peak during the full moon.

- **Eclipses.** Both lunar and solar eclipses occur during "eclipse season", a 35-day period that happens every 6 months. A solar eclipse occurs on every new moon during eclipse season, but only every third is a total solar eclipse; the others are either partial or annular (DM's discretion). 
A lunar eclipse occurs on every full moon during an eclipse season. Keep in mind that lunar eclipses are visible everywhere on earth, but solar eclipses are total eclipses only in a small region. 
The DM decides where the first eclipse season falls and calculates all subsequent seasons according to the rules above. The DM also decides what region each total solar eclipse is visible in.
Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse, and waterbenders lose theirs during a lunar eclipse (also called a "Blood Moon").

- **Comets.** Individual comets are periodic, but on the whole, the passing of a comet does not follow a periodic pattern and as such it is the prerogative of the DM when a comet passes. Comets strengthen firebenders.

- **Day and Night.** Firebenders are stronger during the day, when the sun is out. Waterbenders are strengthened by the moon (which may be out during either the day or the night). The relative length of day and night varies based on the season and latitude.

- **Solstices.** On the summer and winter solstice (day 16 of the 6th and 12th month, respecitvely), the physical and spirit world are at their closest. Spirits can pass into the physical world without passing through a portal. Conversely, it is most difficult to pass between the worlds without assistance during the equinoxes (which fall on day 16 of the 3rd and 9th month, respectively).

- **Harmonic Convergence.** Every 1000 years, the planets in the solar system align. During this alignment, the physical world and the spirit world are separated by nothing more than a thin veil, even closer than on the solstices.
