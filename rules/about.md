# About this Setting

Changes to the classic D&D 5e rules are marked with the<span class="change"></span> badge, while completely new rules are indicated by the<span class="new"></span> badge.

### Using the Bender setting
This class is meant to be played in a world in which the only race is Human and in which the typical arcane magic is replaced with spirit magic. As such, it was not meant to be played in combination with any magical D&D classes.

If you want to include this class in a regular D&D 5e campaign, at 6th level bending attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Skills
This setting uses, for the most part, the same skills as regular 5th edition D&D. These are the exceptions:
- Arcana has been removed
- Religion (Int) has been replaced by Spirituality (Wis)

A custom character sheet that reflects the modifications made to regular D&D 5e abilities, skills, etc. can be found [here](/tools).

### Languages
Common is the only language in this setting. Thus, whenever a background allows you to learn an additional language, you can instead gain proficiency in a new tool, gaming set, or musical instrument. The backgrounds on this site have been adjusted to take this change into account.
