<h1 class="new" id="classes">Waterbender</h1>

Water is the element of change, and just like their namesake, waterbenders are extremely adaptable and versatile. Waterbending concentrates on the flow of energy, focusing less on strength and more on turning the opponent's own energy against them. A bender's victory in battle depends on their skill or ingenuity. 

As practitioners of the element of change, waterbenders can fluidly and quickly alternate from defense to offense, from a wall of ice to a jet of water, turning their opponent's strength against them.

### Chi
Benders make careful study of a magical energy called chi that flows through living bodies. Waterbenders have mastered control of the chi within themselves and are able to extend its influence beyond their body, using the energy to interact with water in their environment. Waterbenders learned how to push and pull water from the original waterbender, the moon, who pushes and pulls the tides.

### Community and Training
Whether they live in the frigid poles, the humid swamps, or near any of the other bodies of water scattered around the globe, waterbenders form tight-knit communities, each with a unique culture. Custom and tradition tend to govern life, sometimes even dictating what type of waterbending particular members of a society may practice. 

Because of these tight community bonds, waterbenders rarely leave their homes unless they have a very good reason. They may spend their entire lives in their home village or town, never setting foot in the outside world.

### Creating a Waterbender
As you make your waterbender character, think about ...
- **The culture of your tribe.** Did you grow up in a small tribe? A larger and more tradition-steeped tribe? At the poles or in the swamp? Or somewhere else entirely? This background will likely influence your bending style and your preferred state of water to bend.
- **How you began training in waterbending.** Were your parents waterbenders? Your siblings? When did you first learn of your abilities? Who became your bending master?
- **Why you left home.** Most waterbenders spend their whole lives in their home town or village. Did something happen to your home that forced you to move? Are you leaving to find a way to save it from some threat? Or did the outside world pull you away for some great mission?

Waterbenders tend towards a Lawful alignment because of their strong sense of community.

> #### Quick Build
> You can make a waterbender quickly by following these suggestions. First, pick Intelligence as your highest score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Sailor background.  

## Class Features

As a waterbender, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per bender level   
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier   
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per waterbender level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons  
**Tools:** Your choice of navigator's tools or water vehicles.

<div style="height: 0em;"></div>

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Dexterity  
**Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Nature, Survival, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- An explorer's pack
- 10 darts
- A pouch of water

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 2em;">
</div>

> ##### Seeing Underwater
> You can see underwater just as well as above water. Areas above water viewed from underwater are considered lightly obscured.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 2em;">
</div>

### Waterbending
At 1st level, you realize that you have an innate ability to control water. You can move small volumes of *liquid* water at will by spending 1 chi of your Attack action to cause the effects of the *Shape Water* cantrip (excluding changing the water's color or opacity). (See "Bending Attack" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks and the rules for bending attacks.) 

The volume and range of water you can control increase with your waterbender level; see the "Volume" and "Range" columns of the Waterbender table. The "Range" column lists two numbers. The first number is your normal range in feet, and the second indicates your long range. You can only draw your bending material from a source within your normal range.


<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Shape Water</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Source: Elemental Evil Player's Companion</p>
    <p><strong>Range:</strong> Normal bending range</p>

    You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.</li>
        <li>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can dismiss a non-instantaneous effect as an action.</p>

<!--/div--> 

You are capable of converting water into ice or snow and back, but without fine-grained control over the shape of the ice or snow. You can cause the effects of the *Grease* spell at will by freezing a thin sheet of water in an area of your choice. Your range for this spell equals your normal bending range.  

When using either *Grease* or changing the state of water from liquid to solid or vice versa in combat, you spend 1 chi of your Attack action (see "Bending Attack" for a description of the role chi points play in attacks).  


### Bending Attack
During combat, you can channel your chi to use your bending as a rudimentary attack by hitting other creatures. Every time you take the Attack action, you draw on your inner pool of energy, or *chi*. The class table shows how much chi you have available for each Attack action ("Chi per Attack"). As your bending grows more powerful and your connection to your inner chi grows, this amount increases.

When you take a basic bending attack, you spend 1 point of chi and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases with your waterbender level and is shown in the "Bending" column of the Waterbender Table. The range of your attacks is the same as your bending range ("Range" column). When you launch water in an attack beyond your normal bending range but within your long range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond your long range. 

At 1st level, you must choose which of your modifiers to use for attacks: Intelligence or Dexterity. This cannot be changed later. Intelligence-based waterbenders are clever and quick thinkers, analyzing their opponents on the fly and using the environment and materials around them in unprecendented ways to gain an edge. Dexterity-based waterbenders are nimble and fast, keeping their opponents off-balance and on their toes.

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<strong>Attack Bonus</strong> = [Int OR Dex modifier] + proficiency bonus
<p><strong>Damage Bonus</strong> = [Int OR Dex modifier]</p>
</div>

The attack bonus is hereafter referred to as your waterbending modifier. 

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
<div class="HBonly">\page</div>

Some of your abilities will require targets to make saving throws against your bending. The DC for these saving throws is your bending DC:

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<p><strong>Bending DC</strong> = 8 + [Int OR Dex mod] + proficiency bonus</p>
</div>

Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC. 

### Stance
Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular stance as your specialty. Choose one of the following options: 

#### Water Ring
In combat, you surround yourself with a ring of water which you can use as your source of bending. While surrounded by this ring, once per turn you can reduce the cost of a bending form by one chi. 

The water also helps protect you from attacks, granting you a +2 bonus to AC.   

You must spend one chi on one of your turns to create the ring and gain these benefits. After 1 minute, the ring disappears, and you must spend another chi to recreate it.

#### Water Arms
You coat your arms in water, increasing your reach by 5 feet. When you take an opportunity attack, you can attempt to grapple the target instead. Your grapple ends if anything passes through the water tendril.  

With these tendrils, you also gain the ability to use your Redirection ability on non-bending melee attacks.    

You must spend one chi on one of your turns to collect water around your arms and gain these benefits.

### Waterbending Forms
Starting at 2nd level, your connection to chi and practice of bending allows you to weave your bending into your combat style. With training, you are able to learn particular attacks that combine martial arts and bending to carry out more sophisticated attacks. 

You learn one form from the list at the end of this class description. The number of forms you know increases with level and is shown in the Waterbender Table. Each time you learn a new form you may also replace one form you already know with another one.  

Every time you take the Attack action on your turn, you have a certain amount of *chi* at your disposal (indicated by the "Chi per Attack" column of the class table). You can distribute your chi among basic bending attacks or regular bending (*cost: 1 chi*) and any forms you know (whose costs are indicated with their descriptions). When you use a form, you add your bending attack bonus to the attack roll but you do not add your bending damage bonus to the resulting damage.

You can use each form a maximum of once per turn. You regain all expended chi at the end of your turn.

#### Chi Exhaustion
Channeling chi into attacks is a physically and mentally draining endeavor.   

You have 3 exhaustion points at your disposal. You can use a d4 to keep track: start the d4 with the "4" pointing up. At the end of each turn in which you use all of your chi, decrement this counter. While the counter is set at 1, you must take a break from bending and cannot spend any chi or take bending reactions. Any bending concentration is also broken. At the end of each turn that you do *not* use all your chi, the counter increments by 1.

For example, say the counter is set at 2. That turn, you spend all your chi points attacking and turn the counter to 1. The next turn, you have 0 chi to spend, and you can either use your Attack action to make a non-bending attack or forfeit it. The next turn, your counter is back up to 2. If you spend all your chi once again, it decreases back to 1 again, but if you spend anything less than the maximum (e.g. all but one chi) the counter once again increases to 3.

### Redirection
At 3rd level, you can use your reaction to attempt to redirect a ranged attack that hits you. This ability applies to
- basic ranged waterbending attacks (not ones that are the result of a bending form nor specialized bending such as an advanced waterbending ability)
- basic ranged earthbending attacks, as long as the volume of earth used in the attack is smaller than the volume of water you use to redirect it
- non-bending ranged attacks

You must have at least one hand free to use this ability. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your waterbending modifier + your waterbender level. If you reduce the damage to 0 and have at least one hand free, you redirect the element to make a ranged attack against a creature of your choice as part of the same reaction.  

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height:0em;">
</div>

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Water in All Its States
At 4th level, you learn to manipulate water more nimbly, creating more intricate shapes. Your water source no longer needs to be liquid: you can bend solid and gaseous water as well, e.g. snow, ice, steam.  

Additionally, you can bend even water you cannot see, such as an underground reservoir (provided it is within range).

### Waterbending specialization
At 5th level, you specialize in one of the following types of waterbending: advanced waterbending, healing, bloodbending, or plantbending. Your abilities are described in the specialization section at the end of this class description.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

<div class="HBonly">\page</div>

### Water Movement
At 6th level, you learn to synchronize your control of water with your movement. You gain the ability to move across liquids. 
<!--When you do so, your speed is doubled.-->

Your control over solid water also grants you the ability to move easily over ice and snow. For you, this type of terrain is no longer difficult terrain.

### Mudbending
Also at 6th level, you learn to bend liquids even if they are not pure water, as long as they consist mostly of water. You learn the following form, which does not count against the total number of forms you know:

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Purify Drink</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Prerequisite: 6th level</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 1 chi</p>

    You gain the abilities granted by the spell <span style="font-style: italic;">Purify Food and Drink</span>, but only for liquids. You can also use this ability to filter any other particles (e.g., earth) out of the water.
</div>

<div class="HBspacing" style="height:1em;">
</div>

### Versatile Reaction
Beginning at 9th level, you react quickly and strategically when you are hit by a melee attack. By spending 1 chi point (from your upcoming turn), you can use your reaction to do one of the following:

#### Freeze
You encase your attacker's hands in ice. At the beginning of each of their turns, they can make a Strength saving throw against your bending DC. 

On a success, the ice breaks. On a failure, their hands remain encased in ice. While their hands are frozen, they have disadvantage on attacks and ability checks that rely on the use of their hands.

#### Pull
You take this opportunity to wrap a tendril of water around your attacker. An attacker at most one size larger is moved 10 feet into an unoccupied space of your choice. They also make a Dexterity saving throw and are knocked prone on a failure.

### Ingenious Fighter
<!-- rename this to use a noun besides "fighter", since the forms can be utility too -->
Beginning at 10th level, your ingenuity and experience with a variety of adversaries have allowed you to adapt another element's fightning style and make it your own. Pick one form from another element-bender's form list (not one that requires a bending specialization) with a cost of 2 chi or less. You can add this form to your list of known forms, and it doesn't count against the total number of forms you know (as indicated by the "Forms Known" column of the Waterbender Table).

When you use this form, you adapt it to use water (in some state) instead of the original element, causing it do deal bludgeoning damage instead of the original damage type. You also use your waterbending modifiers and DCs.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height:3em;">
</div>

### Water Spout
At 13th level, you learn to use your control of water to raise yourself into the air. When you are near a body of water that is at least 30 feet square and 25 feet deep, you can use your action to collect enough water to create a funnel that raises you up to 60 feet in the air. You gain a "flying" speed equal to your ground speed.

When falling into a body of water, you can also use this ability to catch yourself, reducing the effective height of your fall by 60 feet.

### Psychic Bending
Beginning at 14th level, you learn to bend with minimal motion. Your use of bending becomes nearly imperceptible, and you do not suffer disadvantage on bending attacks when restrained as long as you can see your target.

## Waterbending specializations

### Advanced Waterbending

#### Advanced Forms
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you gain access to an extended form list. From now on, you can choose forms to learn from the "Advanced Forms" list in addition to the regular list. Both can be found at the end of this class description.

You also automatically know the form *Water is Everywhere* and it does not count against the "Forms Known" limit in the class table.

#### Mist-Stepping
At 7th level, you are able to use your control over water and ice to move through the air. By quickly freezing tiny pillars of ice beneath your feet, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Expanded Horizons
At 11th level, you have grown accustomed to studying benders of other elements to improve your own bending. Whenever you learn a new form, you can choose from any bending class's form list, with the same effects described in the 10th-level "Ingenious Fighter" ability.

#### ?
At 17th level, ...

### Healing

#### Healing
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself and others. By spending one minute concentrating and passing water over another person's body, you heal them by an amount of hit points equal to three times your waterbender level. 

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier. You regain all expended uses after a long rest.

#### Greater Healing
At 7th level, your healing powers increase. When you heal a creature, you can use your ability to grant the effects of the *Revivify* spell instead of restoring hit points.

#### True Healing
At 11th level, you are able to use the water within your own body and the wounded creature's body instead of requiring liquid water for healing. You can spend an action to heal a creature instantaneously by touching it.

You can also use this ability to reduce the target's exhaustion level by one, end any reduction to one of the target's ability scores, or end one effect reducing the target's hit point maximum.
<!-- based on Greater Restoration-->

#### New Beginnings
At 17th level, you learn to heal even the oldest and deepest wounds. You can use your healing to cause the effects of the *Regenerate* spell.

<!--Spiritbending: https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Healing#Spiritbending -->

### Bloodbending
*Prerequisite: Find a bloodbending master.*
<!-- also... have an evil or at best neutral alignment? -->

#### Paralysis
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to control the water inside others' bodies. You can use your action to attempt to stop one creature at a time in its tracks, provided it is within your range. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.   

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 2em;">
</div>

> ##### Phases of the Moon
> If your GM is using the *Celestial Tracking* variant, the GM will keep track of the current position of the celestial bodies, including the phases of the moon.  
> 
> If you are not using the variant, roll a 1d8 when you wish to use your bloodbending abilities to determine the phase of the moon (at the GM's discretion). An 8 indicates a full moon, whereas rolls of 1-7 correspond to the other phases and lead to diminished bloodbending powers.

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 2em;">
</div>

The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your bending DC. If the moon is full (see the "Phases of the Moon" inset to learn how to determine the phase of the moon), the creature becomes Paralyzed on a failure and Restrained on a success. If the moon is not full, the creature becomes Restrained on a failure and nothing happens on a success.

The condition of the creature persists while you maintain concentration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, the condition (Paralyzed or Restrained) ends and the creature is immune to your bloodbending until it has taken a long rest.

#### Bloodbending
At 7th level, your power grows. During the full moon, you can use your action to attempt to control the movements of a creature instead of only Paralyzing it.  You can use this ability a number of times equal to your bending modifier per long rest.  

The creature makes a saving throw as before. During a full moon, a failure leads it to become Paralyzed and its subsequent movements are under your control. On its turn, you can force the creature to take its movement and one Action (no bonus actions). If you cause it to take the Attack action, it only makes one attack. You can also cause the creature to use a Reaction, but this requires you to use your own Reaction as well. On a success, the creature becomes Paralyzed, but you have no control over its movements.

If the moon is not full, on a failure you can only force the target to use half its movement and take one Action at disadvantage (that is, attacks and ability checks you force it to take are made at disadvantage). You cannot make the creature use its Reaction. With a successful saving throw, the target is only Paralyzed and you have no further control over its actions.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>

<div class="HBonly">\page</div>   

These effects persist while you maintain concentration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, your control ends and the creature is immune to your bloodbending until it has taken a long rest. 

The number of creatures you can control increases with your bloodbender level (waterbender level minus 5); at each level, you can control a number of creatures equal to half your bloodbender level, rounded down (minimum of 1).

#### Greater Bloodbending
At 11th level, your bloodbending control increases. Instead of Paralyzing them, you can cause any subset of the targets that fail to resist your bloodbending to fall unconscious for 1d4 minutes.

#### Bending Block
At 17th level, you learn to use bloodbending to temporarily block another bender's abilities. Once per long rest, if the other bender is Restrained or Incapacitated, you can touch them on the center of the forehead and use an action to remove their bending. They regain their bending after 1d100 hours.

<!--#### Bloodbending Anytime
At 19th level, you are able to bloodbend even on nights without a full moon, excluding those with a new moon.-->

### Plantbending

#### Naturalist
Beginning when you choose this specialization at 5th level, you learn to control the water in plants. You can use the stems of plants instead of water for your waterbending attacks. The stems' physical modifiers are equal to your bending modifier.

Your familiarity with plants makes you adept at traveling and surviving in the regions in which they thrive. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to plant terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in such terrain, you gain the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can’t become lost except by spirit magic.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

#### Greater Plantbending
Your experience bending the water in plants has made you a resourceful fighter. Starting at 7th level, basic waterbending attacks made with plants have a reach of 10 feet. When you hit with such an attack, you can spend another chi to attempt to grapple your target in addition to dealing your normal damage. 

<div class="HBspacing" style="height: 2em;">
</div>

#### Plant Armor
At 11th level, you can summon plants to create a sort of biological armor. You spend one action gathering enough plants to surround you, transforming you into a Large creature. The plant armor gives you temporary hit points equal to your bender level.

#### Spirit Vines
At 17th level, you are able to read the spiritual energy in the connected plant matter of the world. Once per long rest, you can spend at most ten minutes meditating while touching a plant. You essentially cast the spell *Scrying*, allowing you to see the events currently unfolding in another place of your choosing anywhere else in the material world, provided it has some plant cover.

You can also choose to use this ability to gain the benefits of the spell *Commune with Nature* instead.

## Waterbending Forms
Most forms require you to roll to attack, adding your bending attack bonus. You do *not* add a bonus to the damage caused by forms.

Unless otherwise specified, anytime a target is required to make a saving throw, it makes it against your bending DC.

All bonuses are defined at the beginning of the class description (see "Bending Attack").

You start out knowing forms marked with an asterisk.

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>State Change*</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 1 chi</p>
    <p>Each state of water (solid – liquid – gas) can be converted to a state adjacent to it. For example, ice or snow can be turned into liquid water, liquid water can be turned into either solid or gaseous water, but you cannot convert directly between, e.g., snow and water vapor.</p>
    <!--##### Breath of Ice
    Convert liquid water to ice.-->
    <p>To convert to and from gaseous water you must be at least a level 4 waterbender.</p>
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Floor of Ice*</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 1 chi</p>
    You cause the effects of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Grease</span> spell.
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Ice Shield</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 1 chi</p>
    <p>You shape water into a swirling disk by your arm and freeze it. Your AC increases by 2. If an attack that would have hit you without the shield misses because of it (hitting the shield), it deals damage to the shield instead. The Shield has 15 HP and shatters when it drops to 0 and lasts for a maximum of 1 minute.</p>
    <p>Each additional chi point your spend increases the HP of the shield by 10.</p>
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Ice Sword</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Prerequisite: 4th level</p>

    <h4>Water Wall</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 3+ chi</p>
    <!-- Source: Wall of Water spell from Elemental Evil Player's Companion-->
    <p>You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The water falls to the ground after 10 minutes. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.</p>
    <p>You can convert an area of square feet equal to your bending volume (see the "Volume" column of the class table) to ice by spending 1 chi.</p>
    <p>Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Attacks dealing cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.</p>

    <h4>Water Blade</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    <p>You make a waterbending attack, channeling your inner chi to rapidly shape water into a sharp point or edge for a split second when you make contact with the target. On a hit, the attack deals 1d4 slashing damage.   </p>
    <p>If the target is wearing armor and you roll a natural 15 or higher to hit, this gash weakens the armor sufficiently to cause the target's AC to decrease by 1 until they repair the damage done to their armor. You cannot use this ability to decrease a creature's AC below its natural armor class (its AC without armor).</p>
</div>

Roll a waterbending check (using your waterbending modifier) opposed by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the target fails, it is knocked prone.</p>
    <p>The damage increases by an additional die for each extra chi you spend.</p>
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Ice Daggers</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Water Dome</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 3 chi</p>
    <p>You create a protective dome (half-sphere) of water above you. Its radius is equal to your normal bending range. The dome lasts 24 hours unless you dismiss it as a free action.</p>

    <p>You must be outdoors to use this form. Once you create the dome, you control the weather inside it. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky causes the dome to break apart.</p>

    <p>Within the dome, you are protected from wind outside the dome and you can change the precipitation. It takes 6 seconds for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again without expending any chi. When the dome disappears, the weather gradually returns to normal.</p>

    <p>When you change the precipitation, find its current condition on the following table and change its stage by one, up or down.</p>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Water is Everywhere*</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: –</p>
    You learn to draw water from your environment. From now on, you don't need a water source within 30 feet – instead, you can spend 6 seconds (1 round of combat) concentrating to draw water from plants within 30 feet of you. If you are not in an arid environment, you can spend 1 minute drawing water from the air. In both cases, you are able to obtain a water sphere 1 foot in diameter.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    You cause the water level of all standing water in an sphere with radius up to your bending range to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Ice Prison </h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 2 chi</p>
    <p>You cause water to stream along the ground towards a target and erupt upwards into long pillars of ice around it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by this icy cage.</p>
    <p><!-- While restrained by the ice prison, the target takes 1d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. (based on Ensnaring Strike) --> The target or a creature that can touch the target can use its action to make a Strength check against your bending DC. On a success, the target is freed.</p>
    <!-- DC 13 Strength check to break free is based on ice AC -->
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Drowning</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 4 chi</p>
    <p>Pick a target within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you succeed in bending water into the target's lungs and the creature begins drowning (suffocating). While drowning, the target puts all its energy and focus into getting air and is treated as Paralyzed.</p>
    <p>At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, it coughs up the water and stops drowning.</p>
    <p>The effect also ends if you lose concentration.</p>
    <!-- I kind of want using this to have a chance of making a character shift towards an evil alignment -->
</div>

<div class="formCard water">
    <h4>Whirlpool</h4>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cost: 4 chi (+1 chi)</p>
    <p>This form requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your DC.</p>
    <div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
    <div class='footnote'>PART 2 | CLASSES</div>
    <div class="HBonly">\page</div>
    <p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p>
    <p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>
    <!-- From _Control Water_ -->
