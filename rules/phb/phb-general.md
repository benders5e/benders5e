### Planes of Existence
<h4 class="change">Physical World</h4>

The physical world, sometimes also called the material world, is the plane of existence on which humans live. It is divided into four nations corresponding to the elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Benders (and non-benders) of each element usually live in the corresponding nation, with some exceptions. Other groups exist outside of these nations as well, such as the waterbending swamp tribes and the sandbending desert tribes.

The political landscape has varied over time; depending on which period your campaign is set in, areas may fall under different jurisdictions or there may even be new or altogether different entities at play.

<h4 class="new">Spirit World</h4>
The Spirit World is a plane of existence that lies parallel to the physical world and is home to spirits. These supernatural and immortal entities span a wide range of forms and often represent some aspect of life or nature. 

In some cases, the landscape of the Spirit World mirrors that of the physical world; in other cases it is completely unrelated. It can be a very fickle place: the environment can change based on one's emotions, since the spirits are sensitive to changes in their world and any negative energy brought into it.

The simplest way to enter the Spirit World is to physically cross into it through a spirit portal. The two main portals are found at the North and South Pole. Spiritual humans can also pass into the Spirit World through meditation. This difficult process can be aided by attempting passage from very spiritual places in the physical world, or by taking advantage of the proximity of the two worlds during the solstices.

### Opportunity Attacks
Benders can spend a maximum of 1 chi on their opportunity attacks. (See the bending class descriptions for an explanation of the chi mechanic.)

### Underwater Combat
The usual [D&D 5e underwater combat rules](https://dnd5e.info/combat/underwater-combat/) apply. More specifically, for bending attacks and forms, the following rules apply:  
- **Waterbending:** Advantage on all attack rolls; normal damage.  
- **Firebending:** Disadvantage on ranged attacks within normal range (automatic miss beyond normal range), normal roll for touch range attacks. In each case, the attack does half damage if it is dealt underwater (since fully immersed creatures have resistance against fire damage).  
- **Earth- & Airbending:** Disadvantage on melee and ranged attacks within normal range (automatic miss beyond normal range); half damage.

### Nonlethal Damage
- For **melee attacks**, only slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.
- For **ranged attacks**, only bludgeoning damage can be dealt in a nonlethal manner.
